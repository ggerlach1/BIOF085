# Introduction to Data Science using Python

This repository contains teaching materials for a 3-day workshop on using 
Python for data science. 

## Computational environment

This workshop is run using the [Anaconda Python distribution](https;//www.anaconda.com). A `conda` environment to run all the materials can be created using 

```python
conda create -n ds_python python=3.7 anaconda
```
The necessary packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `biopython`, `statsmodels`
The packages `plotly` and `altair` are needed for one document, but are otherwise not covered in the materials. 

## Teaching materials and documents
All the data files used in the workshop are contained in `data`. The homework assignments and solutions are contained in `homeorks`. The introduction document, all sides, and a schedule for the three days are in `workshop_documents`. Administrative materials for running the workshop are in the `workshop_documents` folder. 

The material covered during the workshop is in `jupyter notebooks` as they allow the use of Markdown and embedding for figures. During the workshop most material is covered via live-coding using either `Spyder`, `jupyter`, or `google-colab`. The other component of the class is work from screen cast videos allowing independent work. 

The data and notebooks are also contained in a google drive folder which provides easy access for students unfamiliar with coding in general.
