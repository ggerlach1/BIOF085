The TIOBE index ranks Python as the third most popular programming language after C and Java, while this recent article in IEEE Computer Society says “Python can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based desktop applications, machine learning, data science, and network servers. The programming language enjoys immense community support and offers several open-source libraries, frameworks, and modules that make application development a cakewalk.” (Belani, 2020) 2.1.1 Python is a modular language Python is not a monolithic language but is comprised of a base programming language and numerous modules or libraries that add functionality to the language. Several of these libraries are installed with Python. The Anaconda Python Distribution adds more libraries that are useful for data science. Some libraries we will use include numpy, pandas, seaborn, statsmodels and scikit-learn. In the course of this workshop we will learn how to use Python libraries in your workflow. 2.1.2 Python is a scripting language Using Python requires typing!! You write code in Python that is then interpreted by the Python interpreter to make the computer implement your instructions. Your code is like a recipe that you write for the computer. Python is a high-level language in that the code is English-like and human-readable and understandable, which reduces the time needed for a person to create the recipe. It is a language in that it has nouns (variables or objects), verbs (functions) and a structure or grammar that allows the programmer to write recipes for different functionalities. One thing that is important to note in Python: case is important!. If we have two objects named data and Data, they will refer to different things. Scripting can be frustrating in the beginning. You will find that the code you wrote doesn’t work “for some reason”, though it looks like you wrote it fine. The first things I look for, in order, are Did I spell all the variables and functions correctly Did I close all the brackets I have opened Did I finish all the quotes I started, and paired single- and double-quotes Did I already import the right module for the function I’m trying to use. These may not make sense right now, but as we go into Python, I hope you will remember these to help debug your code. 2.2 An example Let’s consider the following piece of Python code: # set a splitting point split_point = 3 # make two empty lists lower = []; upper = [] # Split numbers from 0 to 9 into two groups, # one lower or equal to the split point and # one higher than the split point for i in range(10): # count from 0 to 9 if i &lt;= split_point: lower.append(i) else: upper.append(i) print(&quot;lower:&quot;, lower) lower: [0, 1, 2, 3] print(&quot;upper:&quot;, upper) upper: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] First note that any line (or part of a line) starting with # is a comment in Python and is ignored by the interpreter. This makes it possible for us to write substantial text to remind us what each piece of our code does The first piece of code that the Python interpreter actually reads is split_point = 3 This takes the number 3 and stores it in the variable split_point. Variables are just names where some Python object is stored. It really works as an address to some particular part of your computer’s memory, telling the Python interpreter to look for the value stored at that particular part of memory. Variable names allow your code to be human-readable since it allows you to write expressive names to remind yourself what you are storing. The rules of variable names are: Variable names must start with a letter or underscore The rest of the name can have letters, numbers or underscores Names are case-sensitive The next piece of code initializes two lists, named lower and upper. lower = []; upper = [] The semi-colon tells Python that, even though written on the same line, a particular instruction ends at the semi-colon, then another piece of instruction is written. Lists are a catch-all data structure that can store different kinds of things, In this case we’ll use them to store numbers. The next piece of code is a for-loop or a loop structure in Python. for i in range(10): # count from 0 to 9 if i &lt;= split_point: lower.append(i) else: upper.append(i) It basically works like this: State with the numbers 0-9 (this is achieved in range(10)) Loop through each number, naming it i each time Computer programs allow you to over-write a variable with a new value If the number currently stored in i is less than or equal to the value of split_point, i.e., 3 then add it to the list lower. Otherwise add it to the list upper Note the indentation in the code. This is not by accident. Python understands the extent of a particular block of code within a for-loop (or within a if statement) using the indentations. In this segment there are 3 code blocks: The for-loop as a whole (1st indentation) The if statement testing if the number is less than or equal to the split point, telling Python what to do if the test is true The else statement stating what to do if the test in the if statement is false Every time a code block starts, the previous line ends in a colon (:). The code block ends when the indentation ends. We’ll go into these elements in a bit. The last bit of code prints out the results print(&quot;lower:&quot;, lower) lower: [0, 1, 2, 3] print(&quot;upper:&quot;, upper) upper: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] The print statement adds some text, and then prints out a representation of the object stored in the variable being printed. In this example, this is a list, and is printed as lower: [0, 1, 2, 3] upper: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] We will expand on these concepts in the next few sections. 2.2.1 Some general rules on Python syntax Comments are marked by # A statement is terminated by the end of a line, or by a ;. Indentation specifies blocks of code within particular structures. Whitespace at the beginning of lines matters. Typically you want to have 2 or 4 spaces to specify indentation, not a tab ( character. This can be set up in your IDE. Whitespace within lines does not matter, so you can use spaces liberally to make your code more readable Parentheses (()) are for grouping pieces of code or for calling functions. There are several conventions about code styling including the one in PEP8 (PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal) and one proposed by Google. We will typically be using lower case names, with words separated by underscores, in this workshop, basically following PEP8. Other conventions are of course allowed as long as they are within the basic rules stated above. 2.3 Data types in Python We start with objects in Python. Objects can be of different types, including numbers (integers and floats), strings, arrays (vectors and matrices) and others. Any object can be assigned to a name, so that we can refer to the object in our code. We’ll start with the basic types of objects. 2.3.1 Numeric variables The following is a line of Python code, where we assign the value 1.2 to the variable a. The act of assigning a name is done using the = sign. This is not equality in the mathematical sense, and has some non-mathematical behavior, as we’ll see a = 1.2 This is an example of a floating-point number or a decimal number, which in Python is called a float. We can verify this in Python itself. type(a) &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; Floating point numbers can be entered either as decimals or in scientific notation x = 0.0005 y = 5e-4 # 5 x 10^(-4) print(x == y) True You can also store integers in a variable. Integers are of course numbers, but can be stored more efficiently on your computer. They are stored as an integer type, called int b = 23 type(b) &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; These are the two primary numerical data types in Python. There are some others that we don’t use as often, called long (for long integers) and complex (for complex numbers) 2.3.1.1 Operations on numbers There is an arithmetic and logic available to operate on elemental data types. For example, we do have addition, subtraction , multiplication and division available. For example, for numbers, we can do the following: Operation Result x + y The sum of x and y x - y The difference of x and y x * y The product of x and y x / y The quotient of x and y - x The negative of x abs(x) The absolute value of x x ** y x raised to the power y int(x) Convert a number to integer float(x) Convert a number to floating point Let’s see some examples: x = 5 y = 2 x + y 7 x - y 3 x * y 10 x / y 2.5 x ** y 25 2.3.2 Strings Strings are how text is represented within Python. It is always represented as a quoted object using either single ('') or double (\"\") quotes, as long as the types of quotes are matched. For example: first_name = &quot;Abhijit&quot; last_name = &quot;Dasgupta&quot; The data type that these are stored in is str. type(first_name) &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; 2.3.2.1 Operations Strings also have some “arithmetic” associated with it, which involves, essentially, concatenation and repetition. Let’s start by considering two character variables that we’ve initialized. a = &quot;a&quot; b = &quot;b&quot; Then we get the following operations and results Operation Result a + b ‘ab’ a * 5 ‘aaaaa’ We can also see if a particular character or character string is part of an exemplar string last_name = &quot;Dasgupta&quot; &quot;gup&quot; in last_name True String manipulation is one of the strong suites of Python. There are several functions that apply to strings, that we will look at throughout the workshop, and especially when we look at string manipulation. In particular, there are built-in functions in base Python and powerful regular expression capabilities in the re module. 2.3.3 Truthiness Truthiness means evaluating the truth of a statement. This typically results in a Boolean object, which can take values True and False, but Python has several equivalent representations. The following values are considered the same as False: None, False, zero (0, 0L, 0.0), any empty sequence ([], '', ()), and a few others All other values are considered True. Usually we’ll denote truth by True and the number 1. 2.3.3.1 Operations We will typically test for the truth of some comparisons. For example, if we have two numbers stored in x and y, then we can perform the following comparisons Operation Result x &lt; y x is strictly less than y x &lt;= y x is less than or equal to y x == y x equals y (note, it’s 2 = signs) x != y x is not equal to y x &gt; y x is strictly greater than y x &gt;= y x is greater or equal to y We can chain these comparisons using Boolean operations Operation Result x | y Either x is true or y is true or both x &amp; y Both x and y are true not x if x is true, then false, and vice versa For example, if we have a number stored in x, and want to find out if it is between 3 and 7, we could write (x &gt;= 3) &amp; (x &lt;= 7) True 2.3.3.2 A note about variables and types Some computer languages like C, C++ and Java require you to specify the type of data that will be held in a particular variable. For example, int x = 4; float y = 3.25; If you try later in the program to assign something of a different type to that variable, you will raise an error. For example, if I did, later in the program, x = 3.95;, that would be an error in C. Python is dynamically typed, in that the same variable name can be assigned to different data types in different parts of the program, and the variable will simply be “overwritten”. (This is not quite correct. What actually happens is that the variable name now “points” to a different part of the computer’s memory where the new data is then stored in appropriate format). So the following is completely fine in Python: x = 4 # An int x = 3.5 # A float x = &quot;That&#39;s my mother&quot; # A str x = True # A bool Variables are like individual ingredients in your recipe. It’s mis en place or setting the table for any operations (functions) we want to do to them. In a language context, variables are like nouns, which will be acted on by verbs (functions). In the next section we’ll look at collections of variables. These collections are important in that it allows us to organize our variables with some structure. 2.4 Data structures in Python Python has several in-built data structures. We’ll describe the three most used ones: Lists ([]) Tuples (()) Dictionaries or dicts ({}) Note that there are three different kinds of brackets being used. Lists are baskets that can contain different kinds of things. They are ordered, so that there is a first element, and a second element, and a last element, in order. However, the kinds of things in a single list doesn’t have to be the same type. Tuples are basically like lists, except that they are immutable, i.e., once they are created, individual values can’t be changed. They are also ordered, so there is a first element, a second element and so on. Dictionaries are unordered key-value pairs, which are very fast for looking up things. They work almost like hash tables. Dictionaries will be very useful to us as we progress towards the PyData stack. Elements need to be referred to by key, not by position. 2.4.1 Lists test_list = [&quot;apple&quot;, 3, True, &quot;Harvey&quot;, 48205] test_list [&#39;apple&#39;, 3, True, &#39;Harvey&#39;, 48205] There are various operations we can do on lists. First, we can determine the length (or size) of the list len(test_list) 5 The list is a catch-all, but we’re usually interested in extracting elements from the list. This can be done by position, since lists are ordered. We can extract the 1st element of the list using test_list[0] &#39;apple&#39; Wait!! The index is 0? Yup. Python is based deep underneath on the C language, where counting starts at 0. So the first element has index 0, second has index 1, and so on. So you need to be careful if you’re used to counting from 1, or, if you’re used to R, which does start counting at 1. We can also extract a set of consecutive elements from a list, which is often convenient. The typical form is to write the index as a:b. The (somewhat confusing) rule is that a:b means that you start at index a, but continue until before index b. So the notation 2:5 means include elements with index 2, 3, and 4. In the Python world, this is called slicing. test_list[2:5] [True, &#39;Harvey&#39;, 48205] If you want to start at the beginning or go to the end, there is a shortcut notation. The same rule holds, though. :3 does not include the element at index 3, but 2: does include the element at index 2. test_list[:3] [&#39;apple&#39;, 3, True] test_list[2:] [True, &#39;Harvey&#39;, 48205] The important thing here is if you provide an index a:b, then a is include but b is not. You can also count backwards from the end. The last element in a Python list has index -1. index 0 1 2 3 4 element ‘apple’ 3 True ‘Harvey’ 48205 counting backwards -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 test_list[-1] 48205 You can also use negative indices to denote sequences within the list, with the same indexing rule applying. Note that you count from the last element (-1) and go backwards. test_list[:-1] [&#39;apple&#39;, 3, True, &#39;Harvey&#39;] test_list[-3:] [True, &#39;Harvey&#39;, 48205] test_list[-3:-1] [True, &#39;Harvey&#39;] You can also make a list of lists, or nested lists test_nested_list = [[1, &quot;a&quot;, 2, &quot;b&quot;], [3, &quot;c&quot;, 4, &quot;d&quot;]] test_nested_list [[1, &#39;a&#39;, 2, &#39;b&#39;], [3, &#39;c&#39;, 4, &#39;d&#39;]] This will come in useful when we talk about arrays and data frames. You can also check if something is in the list, i.e. is a member. &quot;Harvey&quot; in test_list True Lists have the following properties They can be heterogenous (each element can be a different type) Lists can hold complex objects (lists, dicts, other objects) in addition to atomic objects (single numbers or words) List have an ordering, so you can access list elements by position List access can be done counting from the beginning or the end, and consecutive elements can be extracted using slices. 2.4.2 Tuples Tuples are like lists, except that once you create them, you can’t change them. This is why tuples are great if you want to store fixed parameters or entities within your Python code, since they can’t be over-written even by mistake. You can extract elements of a tuple, but you can’t over-write them. This is called immutable. Note that, like lists, tuples can be heterogenous, which is also useful for coding purposes, as we will see. test_tuple = (&quot;apple&quot;, 3, True, &quot;Harvey&quot;, 48205) test_tuple[:3] (&#39;apple&#39;, 3, True) test_list[0] = &quot;pear&quot; test_list [&#39;pear&#39;, 3, True, &#39;Harvey&#39;, 48205] See what happens in the next bit of code test_tuple[0] = &quot;pear&quot; test_tuple (I’m not running this since it gives an error) Tuples are like lists, but once created, they cannot be changed. They are ordered and can be sliced. 2.4.3 Dictionaries Dictionaries, or dict, are collections of key-value pairs. Each element is referred to by key, not by index. In a dictionary, the keys can be strings, numbers or tuples, but the values can be any Python object. So you could have a dictionary where one value is a string, another is a number and a third is a DataFrame (essentially a data set, using the pandas library). A simple example might be an entry in a list of contacts contact = { &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Abhijit&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Dasgupta&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: 48, &quot;address&quot;: &quot;124 Main St&quot;, &quot;Employed&quot;: True, } Note the special syntax. You separate the key-value pairs by colons (:), and each key-value pair is separated by commas. If you get a syntax error creating a dict, look at these first. If you try to get the first name out using an index, you run into an error: contact[0] Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): KeyError: 0 You need to extract it by key contact[&quot;first_name&quot;] &#39;Abhijit&#39; A dictionary is mutable, so you can change the value of any particular element contact[&quot;address&quot;] = &quot;123 Main St&quot; contact[&quot;Employed&quot;] = False contact {&#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Abhijit&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;: &#39;Dasgupta&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;: 48, &#39;address&#39;: &#39;123 Main St&#39;, &#39;Employed&#39;: False} You can see all the keys and values in a dictionary using extractor functions contact.keys() dict_keys([&#39;first_name&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;, &#39;address&#39;, &#39;Employed&#39;]) contact.values() dict_values([&#39;Abhijit&#39;, &#39;Dasgupta&#39;, 48, &#39;123 Main St&#39;, False]) It turns out that dictionaries are really fast in terms of retrieving information, without having to count where an element it. So it is quite useful We’ll see that dictionaries are also one way to easily create pandas DataFrame objects on the fly. There are a couple of other ways to create dict objects. One is using a list of tuples. Each key-value pair is represented by a tuple of length 2, where the 1st element is the key and the second element is the value. A = [(&#39;first_name&#39;,&#39;Abhijit&#39;),(&#39;last_name&#39;,&#39;Dasgupta&#39;),(&#39;address&#39;, &#39;124 Main St&#39;)] dict(A) {&#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Abhijit&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;: &#39;Dasgupta&#39;, &#39;address&#39;: &#39;124 Main St&#39;} This actually can be utilized to create a dict from a pair of lists. There is a really neat function, zip, that inputs several lists of the same length and creates a list of tuples, where the i-th element of each tuple comes from the i-th list, in order. A = [&#39;first_name&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;,&#39;address&#39;] B = [&#39;Abhijit&#39;,&#39;Dasgupta&#39;,&#39;124 Main St&#39;] dict(zip(A, B)) {&#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Abhijit&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;: &#39;Dasgupta&#39;, &#39;address&#39;: &#39;124 Main St&#39;} The zip function is quite powerful in putting several lists together with corresponding elements of each list into a tuple On a side note, there is a function defaultdict from the collections module that is probably better to use. We’ll come back to it when we talk about modules. 2.5 Operational structures in Python 2.5.1 Loops and list comprehensions Loops are a basic construct in computer programming. The basic idea is that you have a recipe that you want to repeatedly run on different entities that you have created. The crude option would be to copy and paste your code several times, changing whatever inputs change across the entities. This is not only error-prone, but inefficient given that loops are a standard element of all programming languages. You can create a list of these entities, and, using a loop, run your recipe on each entity automatically. For example, you have a data about votes in the presidential election from all 50 states, and you want to figure out what the percent voting for each major party is. So you could write this recipe in pseudocode as Start with a list of datasets, one for each state for each state compute and store fraction of votes that are Republican compute and store fraction of votes that are Democratic This is just English, but it can be translated easily into actual code. We’ll attempt that at the end of this section. The basic idea of a list is that there is a list of things you want to iterate over. You create a dummy variable as stand-in for each element of that list. Then you create a for-loop. This works like a conveyor belt and basket, so to speak. You line up elements of the list on the conveyor belt, and as you run the loop, one element of the list is “scooped up” and processed. Once that processing is done, the next element is “scooped up”, and so forth. The dummy variable is essentially the basket (so the same basket (variable name) is re-used over and over until the conveyor belt (list) is empty). In the examples below, we are showing a common use of for loops where we are enumerating the elements of a list as 0, 1, 2, … using range(len(test_list)). So the dummy variable i takes values 0, 1, 2, … until the length of the list is reached. For each value of i, this for loop prints the i-th element of test_list. for i in range(len(test_list)): print(test_list[i]) pear 3 True Harvey 48205 Sometimes using the index number is easier to understand. However, we don’t need to do this. We can just send the list itself into the for-loop (u) now is the dummy variable containing the actual element of test_list. We’ll get the same answer. for u in test_list: print(u) pear 3 True Harvey 48205 The general structure for a for loop is: for (element) in (list): do some stuff do more stuff As a more practical example, let’s try and sum a set of numbers using a for-loop (we’ll see much better ways of doing this later) test_list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] mysum = 0 for u in test_list2: mysum = mysum + u print(mysum) 55 There are two things to note here. The code mysum = mysum + u is perfectly valid, once you realize that this isn’t really math but an assignment or pointer to a location in memory. This code says that you find the current value stored in mysum, add the value of u to it, and then store it back into the storage that mysum points to Indentation matters! Indent the last line and see what happens when you run this code 2.5.1.1 A little deeper The entity to the right of the in in the for-loop can be an iterator, which is a generalization of a list. For example, we used range(len(test_list2)) above. If we just type range(10) range(0, 10) nothing really happens. This is an example of an iterator, which is only evaluated when it is called, rather than being stored in memory. This is useful especially when you iterate over large numbers of things, in terms of preserving memory and speed. To see the corresponding list, you would do list(range(10)) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] This range iterator is quite flexible: list(range(5, 10)) # range from 5 to 10 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] list(range(0, 10, 2)) # range from 0 to 10 by 2 [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] Note the rules here are very much like the slicing rules. Other iterators that are often useful are the enumerate iterator and the zip iterator. enumerate automatically creates both the index and the value for each element of a list. L = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] for i, val in enumerate(L): print(i, val) 0 0 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 zip puts multiple lists together and creates a composite iterator. You can have any number of iterators in zip, and the length of the result is determined by the length of the shortest iterator. We introduced an example of zip as a way to create a dict. Technically, zip can take multiple iterators as inputs, not just lists first = [&quot;Han&quot;, &quot;Luke&quot;, &quot;Leia&quot;, &quot;Anakin&quot;] last = [&quot;Solo&quot;, &quot;Skywalker&quot;, &quot;Skywaker&quot;, &quot;Skywalker&quot;] types = [&#39;light&#39;,&#39;light&#39;,&#39;light&#39;,&#39;light/dark/light&#39;] for val1, val2, val3 in zip(first, last, types): print(val1, val2, &#39; : &#39;, val3) Han Solo : light Luke Skywalker : light Leia Skywaker : light Anakin Skywalker : light/dark/light 2.5.1.2 Controlling loops There are two statements that can affect how loops run: The break statement breaks out of the loop The continue statement skips the rest of the current loop and continues to the next element For example x = list(range(10)) for u in x: if u % 2 == 1: # If u / 2 gives a remainder of 1 continue if u &gt;= 8: break print(u) 0 2 4 6 In this loop, we don’t print the odd numbers, and we stop the loop once it gets to 8. 2.5.2 List comprehensions List comprehensions are quick ways of generating a list from another list by using some recipe. For example, if we wanted to create a list of the squares of all the numbers in test_list2, we could write squares = [u ** 2 for u in test_list2] squares [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] Similarly, if we wanted to find out what the types of each element of test_tuple is, we could use [type(u) for u in test_tuple] [&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;] Exercise: Can you use a list comprehension to find out the types of each element of the contact dict? We can also use list comprehensions to extract arbitrary sets of elements of lists test = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;f&#39;,&#39;g&#39;] test1 = [test[i] for i in [0,2,3,5]] test1 [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;f&#39;] 2.5.3 Conditional evaluations The basic structure for conditional evaluation of code is an if-then-else structure. if Condition 1 is true then do Recipe 1 else if (elif) Condition 2 is true then do Recipe 2 else do Recipe 3 In Python, this is implemented as a if-elif-else structure. Let’s take an example where we have a list of numbers, and we want to record whether the number is negative, odd, or even. x = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] y = [] # an empty list for u in x: if u &lt; 0: y.append(&quot;Negative&quot;) elif u % 2 == 1: # what is remainder when dividing by 2 y.append(&quot;Odd&quot;) else: y.append(&quot;Even&quot;) print(y) [&#39;Negative&#39;, &#39;Negative&#39;, &#39;Even&#39;, &#39;Odd&#39;, &#39;Even&#39;, &#39;Odd&#39;, &#39;Even&#39;, &#39;Odd&#39;, &#39;Even&#39;, &#39;Odd&#39;, &#39;Even&#39;, &#39;Odd&#39;, &#39;Even&#39;] Note here that the indentation (leading whitespace) is crucial to this structure. The if-elif-else structure is embedded in a for-loop, so the entire structure in indented. Also, each particular recipe is also indented within the if-elif-else structure. The elif is optional, in that if you have only 2 conditions, then an if-else structure is sufficient. However, you can have multiple elif’s if you have more conditions. This kind of structure has to start with an if, end with an else and can have 0 or more elif in the middle. 2.6 Functions We’ve already seen some examples of functions, such as the print() function. For example, if we write print(y), the function name is print and the functions argument is y. So what are functions? Functions are basically encapsulated recipes. They are groups of code that are given a name and can be called with 0 or more arguments. In a cookbook, you might have a recipe for pasta primavera. This is the name of a recipe that has ingredients and a method to cook. In Python, a similar recipe for the mean might be as follows: def my_mean(x): y = 0 for u in x: y += u y = y / len(x) return y This takes a list of numbers x, loops over the elements of x to find their sum, and then divides by the length of x to compute the mean. It then returns this mean. The notation += is a shortcut often used in programming. The statement y += u means, take the current value of y, add the value of u to it, and store it back in to y. This is a shorthand for y = y + u. In analogous fashion, you can use -=, *= and /= to do subtraction, multiplication and division respectively. A Python function must start with the keyword def followed by the name of the function, the arguments within parentheses, and then a colon. The actual code for the function is indented, just like in for-loops and if-elif-else structures. It ends with a return function which specifies the output of the function. To use the my_mean function, x = list(range(10)) my_mean(x) 4.5 2.6.1 Documenting your functions Python has an in-built documentation system that allows you to readily document your functions using docstrings. Basically, right after the first line with def, you can create a (multi-line) string that documents the function and will be printed if the help system is used for that function. You can create a multi-line string by bounding it with 3 quotation marks on each side. For example, def my_mean(x): &quot;&quot;&quot; A function to compute the mean of a list of numbers. INPUTS: x : a list containing numbers OUTPUT: The arithmetic mean of the list of numbers &quot;&quot;&quot; y = 0 for u in x: y = y + u y = y / len(x) return y help(my_mean) Help on function my_mean in module __main__: my_mean(x) A function to compute the mean of a list of numbers. INPUTS: x : a list containing numbers OUTPUT: The arithmetic mean of the list of numbers 2.7 Modules and Packages Python itself was built with the principle “Batteries included”, in that it already comes with useful tools for a wide variety of tasks. On top of that, there is a large ecosystem of third-party tools and packages that can be added on to add more functionality. Almost all the data science functionality in Python comes from third-party packages. 2.7.1 Using modules The Python standard library as well as third-party packages (which I’ll use interchangeably with the term libraries) are structured as modules. In order to use a particular module you have to “activate” it in your Python session using the import statement. import math math.cos(math.pi) -1.0 In these statements, we have imported the math module. This module has many functions, one of which is the cosine or cos function. We use the notation math.cos to let Python know that we want to use the cos function that is in the math module. The value of \\(\\pi\\) is also stored in the math module as math.pi, ie. the element pi within the moduel math. Modules can often have long names, so Python caters to our laziness by allowing us to create aliases for modules when we import them. In this workshop we will use the following statements quite often import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt These statements import 3 modules into the current Python session, namely numpy, pandas and a submodule of the matplotlib module called pyplot. In each case, we have provided an alias to the module that is imported. So, in subsequent calls, we can just use the aliases. np.cos(np.pi) -1.0 If we only want some particular components of a module to be imported, we can specify them using the from ... import ... syntax. These imported components will not need the module specification when we subsequently use them. from math import pi, sin, cos print(sin(pi)) 1.2246467991473532e-16 print(cos(pi)) -1.0 We had made reference to the defaultdict function from the collections module before. Using this instead of dict can be advantagous sometimes in data scientific work. from collections import defaultdict A = defaultdict(list) # Specify each component will be a list B = {} s = [(&#39;yellow&#39;, 1), (&#39;blue&#39;, 2), (&#39;yellow&#39;, 3), (&#39;blue&#39;, 4), (&#39;red&#39;, 1)] for k,v in s: # k = key, v = value B[k].append(v) Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): KeyError: &#39;yellow&#39; for k,v in s: A[k].append(v) A defaultdict(&lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt;, {&#39;yellow&#39;: [1, 3], &#39;blue&#39;: [2, 4], &#39;red&#39;: [1]}) The defaultdict sees a new key, and adds it to the dict, initializing it with an empty list (since we specified defaultdict(list). The normal dict requires the key to already be in place in the dict for any operations to take place on that key-value pair. So the default dict is safer for on-the-fly work and when we don’t know beforehand what keys we will encounter when storing data into the dict. There is a temptation to use this method to import everything in a module so you don’t have to specify the module. This is a bad practice generally, both because you clutter up the namespace that Python reads from, and because you may unknowingly over-write and replace a function from one module with one from another module, and you will have a hard time debugging your code. The code you do NOT want to use is from math import * 2.7.2 Useful modules in Python’s standard library Module Description os and sys Interfacing with the operating system, including files, directories, and executing shell commands math and cmath Mathematical functions itertools Constructing and using iterators random Generate random numbers collections More general collections for objects, beyond lists, tuples and dicts 2.7.3 Installing third-party packages/libraries The Anaconda Python distribution comes with its own installer and package manager called conda. The Anaconda repository contains most of the useful packages for data science, and many come pre-installed with the distribution. However, you can easily install packages using the conda manager. conda install pandas would install the pandas package into your Python installation. If you wanted a particular version of this package, you could use conda install pandas=0.23 to install version 0.23 of the pandas package. Anaconda also provides a repository for user-created packages. For example, to install the Python package RISE which I use for creating slides from Jupyter notebooks, I use conda install -c conda-forge rise Sometimes you may find a Python package that is not part of the Anaconda repositories. Then you can use the more general Python program pip to install packages pip install supersmoother This goes looking in the general Python package repository PyPi, which you can also search on a web browser. 2.8 Environments One of the nice things about Python is that you can set up environments for particular projects, that have all the packages you need for that project, without having to install those packages system-wide. This practice is highly recommended, since it creates a sandbox for you to play in for a project without contaminating the code from another project. The Anaconda distribution and the conda program make this quite easy. There are a couple of ways of doing this. 2.8.1 Command-line/shell You can open up a command line terminal (any terminal on Mac and Linux, the Anaconda Terminal in Windows) to create a new environment. For example, I have an environment I call ds that is my data science environment. This will include the packages numpy, scipy, pandas,matplotlib, seaborn,statsmodels and scikit-learn in it. The quick way to do this is conda create -n ds numpy scipy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn To use this environment, at the command line, type conda activate ds Once you’re done using it, at the command line, type conda deactivate When your environment is activated, you’ll see the name of the environment before the command prompt image-20200511003754816 2.8.2 Using Anaconda Navigator Open the Anaconda Navigator from your start menu or using Spotlight on a Mac. Within the app is a section named “Environments” image-20200511004048781 At the bottom of the 2nd pane, you can see a “Create” button. Clicking it creates a pop-up window. image-20200511004259459 I’ve named this new environment ds1 since I already have a ds environment. Click “Create”. You’ll have to wait a bit of time for the environment to be created. You can then add/install packages to this environment by clicking on packages on the right panel, making sure you changed the first drop-down menu from “Installed” to “Not installed”. image-20200511004530076 Once you’ve selected the packages you want to install, click “Appy” on the bottom right of the window. To activate an environment, you can go to the Home pane for Anaconda Navigator and change the environment on the “Applications on” drop-down menu. image-20200511004920105 2.8.3 Reproducing environments Suppose you’ve got an environment set up the way you like it, and want to clone it on another machine that has Anaconda installed. There is an easy way to do this. You have to use the command line (Anaconda Prompt (Win) or a terminal) for this. First activate the environment you want to export (I’ll use ds as an example) conda activate ds Then export the environment specifications which includes all the packages installed in that environment conda env export &gt; environment.yml You can take this environment.yml file to a new computer, or e-mail it to a collaborator to install the environment. This environment can be created on the new computer using conda env create -f environment.yml where the first line of the environment.yml file creates the environment name. You can also create the environment from an environment.yml file from Anaconda Navigator by using the Import button rather than the Create button in the instructions above. If you are changing operating systems, create the environment.yml file using the command conda env export --from-history &gt; environment.yml This avoids potential issues with dependencies that may not be compatible across operating systems 2.9 Seeking help Most Python functions have some amount of documentation. As we saw when we created our own function, this documentation is part of the function definition. It can be accessed at the Python console in 2 ways: help(sum) Help on built-in function sum in module builtins: sum(iterable, /, start=0) Return the sum of a &#39;start&#39; value (default: 0) plus an iterable of numbers When the iterable is empty, return the start value. This function is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may reject non-numeric types. or # sum? You can see the documentation of the my_sum function we created earlier in this way, as well. Other resources that are your friends in the internet age are Stack Overflow: This is a Q &amp; A site.

["python-tools-for-data-science.html", "Chapter 3 Python tools for data science 3.1 The PyData Stack 3.2 Numpy (numerical and scientific computing)", " Chapter 3 Python tools for data science (last updated 2020-05-18) 3.1 The PyData Stack The Python Data Stack comprises a set of packages that makes Python a powerful data science language. These include Numpy: provides arrays and matrix algebra Scipy: provides scientific computing capabilities matplotlib: provides graphing capabilities These were the original stack that was meant to replace Matlab. However, these were meant to tackle purely numerical data, and the kinds of heterogeneous data we regularly face needed more tools. These were added more recently. Pandas: provides data analytic structures like the data frame, as well as basic descriptive statistical capabilities statsmodels: provides a fairly comprehensive set of statistical functions scikit-learn: provides machine learning capabilities This is the basic stack of packages we will be using in this workshop. Additionally we will use a few packages that add some functionality to the data science process. These include seaborn: Better statistical graphs plotly: Interactive graphics biopython: Python for bioinformatics We may also introduce the package rpy2 which allows one to run R from within Python. This can be useful since many bioinformatic pipelines are already implemented in R. The PyData stack also includes sympy, a symbolic mathematics package emulating Maple 3.2 Numpy (numerical and scientific computing) We start by importing the Numpy package into Python using the alias np. import numpy as np Numpy provides both arrays (vectors, matrices, higher dimensional arrays) and vectorized functions which are very fast. Let’s see how this works. z = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.3,10.6] # This is a list z_array = np.array(z) z_array array([ 1. , 2. , 3. , 4. , 5. , 6. , 7. , 8. , 9.3, 10.6]) Now, we have already seen functions in Python earlier. In Numpy, there are functions that are optimized for arrays, that can be accessed directly from the array objects. This is an example of object-oriented programming in Python, where functions are provided for particular classes of objects, and which can be directly accessed from the objects. We will use several such functions over the course of this workshop, but we won’t actually talk about how to do this program development here. Numpy functions are often very fast, and are vectorized, i.e., they are written to work on vectors of numbers rather than single numbers. This is an advantage in data science since we often want to do the same operation to all elements of a column of data, which is essentially a vector We apply the functions sum, min (minimum value) and max (maximum value) to z_array. z_array.sum() 55.9 z_array.min() 1.0 z_array.max() 10.6 The versions of these functions in Numpy are optimized for arrays and are quite a bit faster than the corresponding functions available in base Python. When doing data work, these are the preferred functions. These functions can also be used in the usual function manner: np.max(z_array) 10.6 Calling np.max ensures that we are using the max function from numpy, and not the one in base Python. 3.2.1 Numpy data types Numpy arrays are homogeneous in type. np.array([&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;]) array([&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;], dtype=&#39;&lt;U1&#39;) np.array([1,2,3,6,8,29]) array([ 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 29]) But, what if we provide a heterogeneous list? y = [1,3,&#39;a&#39;] np.array(y) array([&#39;1&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;a&#39;], dtype=&#39;&lt;U21&#39;) So what’s going on here? Upon conversion from a heterogeneous list, numpy converted the numbers into strings. This is necessary since, by definition, numpy arrays can hold data of a single type. When one of the elements is a string, numpy casts all the other entities into strings as well. Think about what would happen if the opposite rule was used. The string ‘a’ doesn’t have a corresponding number, while both numbers 1 and 3 have corresponding string representations, so going from string to numeric would create all sorts of problems. The advantage of numpy arrays is that the data is stored in a contiguous section of memory, and you can be very efficient with homogeneous arrays in terms of manipulating them, applying functions, etc. However, numpy does provide a “catch-all” dtype called object, which can be any Python object. This dtype essentially is an array of pointers to actual data stored in different parts of the memory. You can get to the actual objects by extracting them. So one could do np.array([1,3,&#39;a&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) array([1, 3, &#39;a&#39;], dtype=object) which would basically be a valid numpy array, but would go back to the actual objects when used, much like a list. We can see this later if we want to transform a heterogeneous pandas DataFrame into a numpy array. It’s not particularly useful as is, but it prevents errors from popping up during transformations from pandas to numpy. 3.2.2 Generating data in numpy We had seen earlier how we could generate a sequence of numbers in a list using range. In numpy, you can generate a sequence of numbers in an array using arange (which actually creates the array rather than provide an iterator like range). np.arange(10) array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) You can also generate regularly spaced sequences of numbers between particular values np.linspace(start=0, stop=1, num=11) # or np.linspace(0, 1, 11) array([0. , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1. ]) You can also do this with real numbers rather than integers. np.linspace(start = 0, stop = 2*np.pi, num = 10) array([0. , 0.6981317 , 1.3962634 , 2.0943951 , 2.7925268 , 3.4906585 , 4.1887902 , 4.88692191, 5.58505361, 6.28318531]) More generally, you can transform lists into numpy arrays. We saw this above for vectors. For matrices, you can provide a list of lists. Note the double [ in front and back. np.array([[1,3,5,6],[4,3,9,7]]) array([[1, 3, 5, 6], [4, 3, 9, 7]]) You can generate an array of 0’s np.zeros(10) array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]) This can easily be extended to a two-dimensional array (a matrix), by specifying the dimension of the matrix as a tuple. np.zeros((10,10)) array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]]) You can also generate a matrix of 1s in a similar manner. np.ones((3,4)) array([[1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.]]) In matrix algebra, the identity matrix is important. It is a square matrix with 1’s on the diagonal and 0’s everywhere else. np.eye(4) array([[1., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 1.]]) You can also create numpy vectors directly from lists, as long as lists are made up of atomic elements of the same type. This means a list of numbers or a list of strings. The elements can’t be more composite structures, generally. One exception is a list of lists, where all the lists contain the same type of atomic data, which, as we will see, can be used to create a matrix or 2-dimensional array. a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] b = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;3&#39;] np.array(a) array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) np.array(b) array([&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;3&#39;], dtype=&#39;&lt;U1&#39;) 3.2.2.1 Random numbers Generating random numbers is quite useful in many areas of data science. All computers don’t produce truly random numbers but generate pseudo-random sequences. These are completely deterministic sequences defined algorithmically that emulate the properties of random numbers. Since these are deterministic, we can set a seed or starting value for the sequence, so that we can exactly reproduce this sequence to help debug our code. To actually see how things behave in simulations we will often run several sequences of random numbers starting at different seed values. The seed is set by the RandomState function within the random submodule of numpy. Note that all Python names are case-sensitive. rng = np.random.RandomState(35) # set seed rng.randint(0, 10, (3,4)) array([[9, 7, 1, 0], [9, 8, 8, 8], [9, 7, 7, 8]]) We have created a 3x4 matrix of random integers between 0 and 10 (in line with slicing rules, this includes 0 but not 10). We can also create a random sample of numbers between 0 and 1. rng.random_sample((5,2)) array([[0.04580216, 0.91259827], [0.21381599, 0.3036373 ], [0.98906362, 0.1858815 ], [0.98872484, 0.75008423], [0.22238605, 0.14790391]]) We’ll see later how to generate random numbers from particular probability distributions. 3.2.3 Vectors and matrices Numpy generates arrays, which can be of arbitrary dimension. However the most useful are vectors (1-d arrays) and matrices (2-d arrays). In these examples, we will generate samples from the Normal (Gaussian) distribution, with mean 0 and variance 1. A = rng.normal(0,1,(4,5)) We can compute some characteristics of this matrix’s dimensions. The number of rows and columns are given by shape. A.shape (4, 5) The total number of elements are given by size. A.size 20 If we want to create a matrix of 0’s with the same dimensions as A, we don’t actually have to compute its dimensions. We can use the zeros_like function to figure it out. np.zeros_like(A) array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]]) We can also create vectors by only providing the number of rows to the random sampling function. The number of columns will be assumed to be 1. B = rng.normal(0, 1, (4,)) B array([-0.45495378, 1.04307172, 0.70451207, -0.6171649 ]) 3.2.3.1 Extracting elements from arrays The syntax for extracting elements from arrays is almost exactly the same as for lists, with the same rules for slices. Exercise: State what elements of B are extracted by each of the following statements B[:3] B[:-1] B[[0,2,4]] B[[0,2,5]] For matrices, we have two dimensions, so you can slice by rows, or columns or both. A array([[-2.45677354, 0.36686697, -0.20453263, -0.54380446, 0.09524207], [ 1.06236144, 1.03937554, 0.01247733, -0.35427727, -1.18997812], [ 0.95554288, 0.30781478, 0.7328766 , -1.28670314, -1.03870027], [-0.81398211, -1.02506031, 0.12407205, 1.21491023, -1.44645123]]) We can extract the first column by specifying : (meaning everything) for the rows, and the index for the column (reminder, Python starts counting at 0) A[:,0] array([-2.45677354, 1.06236144, 0.95554288, -0.81398211]) Similarly the 4th row can be extracted by putting the row index, and : for the column index. A[3,:] array([-0.81398211, -1.02506031, 0.12407205, 1.21491023, -1.44645123]) All slicing operations work for rows and columns A[:2,:2] array([[-2.45677354, 0.36686697], [ 1.06236144, 1.03937554]]) 3.2.3.2 Array operations We can do a variety of vector and matrix operations in numpy. First, all usual arithmetic operations work on arrays, like adding or multiplying an array with a scalar. A = rng.randn(3,5) A array([[-0.15367796, 2.50215522, 0.19420725, 0.54928294, -1.1737166 ], [ 1.11456557, 0.07447758, 1.58518354, 1.61986225, -0.24616333], [-0.02682273, 0.2196577 , 0.41680351, -0.86319929, 0.50355595]]) A + 10 array([[ 9.84632204, 12.50215522, 10.19420725, 10.54928294, 8.8262834 ], [11.11456557, 10.07447758, 11.58518354, 11.61986225, 9.75383667], [ 9.97317727, 10.2196577 , 10.41680351, 9.13680071, 10.50355595]]) We can also add and multiply arrays element-wise as long as they are the same shape. B = rng.randint(0,10, (3,5)) B array([[6, 2, 3, 9, 8], [5, 9, 3, 9, 7], [0, 4, 2, 5, 0]]) A + B array([[ 5.84632204, 4.50215522, 3.19420725, 9.54928294, 6.8262834 ], [ 6.11456557, 9.07447758, 4.58518354, 10.61986225, 6.75383667], [-0.02682273, 4.2196577 , 2.41680351, 4.13680071, 0.50355595]]) A * B array([[-0.92206775, 5.00431043, 0.58262175, 4.94354649, -9.38973278], [ 5.57282784, 0.67029821, 4.75555061, 14.57876027, -1.72314331], [-0. , 0.8786308 , 0.83360701, -4.31599644, 0. ]]) You can also do matrix multiplication. Recall what this is. If you have a matrix \\(A_{m x n}\\) and another matrix \\(B_{n x p}\\), as long as the number of columns of \\(A\\) and rows of \\(B\\) are the same, you can multiply them (\\(C_{m x p} = A_{m x n}B_{n x p}\\)), with the (i,j)-th element of C being \\[ c_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}, i= 1, \\dots, m; j = 1, \\dots, p\\] In numpy the operant for matrix multiplication is @. In the above examples, A and B cannot be multiplied since they have incompatible dimensions. However, we can take the transpose of B, i.e. flip the rows and columns, to make it compatible with A for matrix multiplication. A @ np.transpose(B) array([[ 0.21867814, 19.0611592 , 13.14345008], [24.20135281, 23.85429363, 11.56758865], [-2.21155643, -1.15068575, -2.60375863]]) np.transpose(A) @ B array([[ 4.65076009, 9.61644327, 2.82901737, 8.51387483, 6.57253531], [ 15.38531919, 6.55323945, 8.16921379, 24.28798365, 20.53858478], [ 9.09116118, 16.32228035, 6.17177937, 18.0985346 , 12.64994275], [ 11.39500892, 12.22452901, 4.78103701, 15.20631032, 15.73329932], [ -8.27311623, -2.54867934, -3.25252787, -10.26113957, -11.11287609]]) More generally, you can reshape a numpy array into a new shape, provided it is compatible with the number of elements in the original array. D = rng.randint(0,5, (4,4)) D array([[0, 2, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [0, 3, 2, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3]]) D.reshape(8,2) array([[0, 2], [0, 0], [4, 0], [0, 4], [0, 3], [2, 0], [3, 0], [0, 3]]) D.reshape(1,16) array([[0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]]) This can also be used to cast a vector into a matrix. e = np.arange(20) E = e.reshape(5,4) E array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6, 7], [ 8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19]]) One thing to note in all the reshaping operations above is that the new array takes elements of the old array by row. See the examples above to convince yourself of that. 3.2.3.3 Statistical operations on arrays You can sum all the elements of a matrix using sum. You can also sum along rows or along columns by adding an argument to the sum function. A = rng.normal(0, 1, (4,2)) A array([[-1.60798054, -0.05162306], [-0.49218049, -0.1262316 ], [ 0.56927597, 0.05438786], [ 0.33120322, -0.81820729]]) A.sum() -2.141355938226197 You can sum along rows (i.e., down columns) with the option axis = 0 A.sum(axis=0) array([-1.19968185, -0.94167409]) You can sum along columns (i.e., across rows) with axis = 1. A.sum(axis=1) array([-1.6596036 , -0.61841209, 0.62366383, -0.48700407]) Of course, you can use the usual function calls: np.sum(A, axis = 1) We can also find the minimum and maximum values. A.min(axis = 0) array([-1.60798054, -0.81820729]) A.max(axis = 0) array([0.56927597, 0.05438786]) We can also find the position where the minimum and maximum values occur. A.argmin(axis=0) array([0, 3]) A.argmax(axis=0) array([2, 2]) We can sort arrays and also find the indices which will result in the sorted array. I’ll demonstrate this for a vector, where it is more relevant a = rng.randint(0,10, 8) a array([9, 2, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 4]) np.sort(a) array([2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9]) np.argsort(a) array([1, 6, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3, 0]) a[np.argsort(a)] array([2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9]) np.argsort can also help you find the 2nd smallest or 3rd largest value in an array, too. ind_2nd_smallest = np.argsort(a)[1] a[ind_2nd_smallest] 3 ind_3rd_largest = np.argsort(a)[-3] a[ind_3rd_largest] 6 You can also sort strings in this way. m = np.array([&#39;Aram&#39;,&#39;Raymond&#39;,&#39;Elizabeth&#39;,&#39;Donald&#39;,&#39;Harold&#39;]) np.sort(m) array([&#39;Aram&#39;, &#39;Donald&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth&#39;, &#39;Harold&#39;, &#39;Raymond&#39;], dtype=&#39;&lt;U9&#39;) If you want to sort arrays in place, you can use the sort function in a different way. m.sort() m array([&#39;Aram&#39;, &#39;Donald&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth&#39;, &#39;Harold&#39;, &#39;Raymond&#39;], dtype=&#39;&lt;U9&#39;) 3.2.3.4 Putting arrays together We can put arrays together by row or column, provided the corresponding axes have compatible lengths. A = rng.randint(0,5, (3,5)) B = rng.randint(0,5, (3,5)) print(&#39;A = &#39;, A) A = [[3 4 2 1 3] [0 3 1 1 1] [4 0 2 0 4]] print(&#39;B = &#39;, B) B = [[1 4 2 1 3] [2 0 3 2 0] [4 0 2 3 3]] np.hstack((A,B)) array([[3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3], [0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 0], [4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 3]]) np.vstack((A,B)) array([[3, 4, 2, 1, 3], [0, 3, 1, 1, 1], [4, 0, 2, 0, 4], [1, 4, 2, 1, 3], [2, 0, 3, 2, 0], [4, 0, 2, 3, 3]]) Note that both hstack and vstack take a tuple of arrays as input. 3.2.3.5 Logical/Boolean operations You can query a matrix to see which elements meet some criterion. In this example, we’ll see which elements are negative. A &lt; 0 array([[False, False, False, False, False], [False, False, False, False, False], [False, False, False, False, False]]) This is called masking, and is useful in many contexts. We can extract all the negative elements of A using A[A&lt;0] array([], dtype=int64) This forms a 1-d array. You can also count the number of elements that meet the criterion np.sum(A&lt;0) 0 Since the entity A&lt;0 is a matrix as well, we can do row-wise and column-wise operations as well. 3.2.4 Beware of copies One has to be a bit careful with copying objects in Python. By default, if you just assign one object to a new name, it does a shallow copy, which means that both names point to the same memory. So if you change something in the original, it also changes in the new copy. A[0,:] array([3, 4, 2, 1, 3]) A1 = A A1[0,0] = 4 A[0,0] 4 To actually create a copy that is not linked back to the original, you have to make a deep copy, which creates a new space in memory and a new pointer, and copies the original object to the new memory location A1 = A.copy() A1[0,0] = 6 A[0,0] 4 You can also replace sub-matrices of a matrix with new data, provided that the dimensions are compatible. (Make sure that the sub-matrix we are replacing below truly has 2 rows and 2 columns, which is what np.eye(2) will produce) A[:2,:2] = np.eye(2) A array([[1, 0, 2, 1, 3], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [4, 0, 2, 0, 4]]) 3.2.4.1 Reducing matrix dimensions Sometimes the output of some operation ends up being a matrix of one column or one row. We can reduce it to become a vector. There are two functions that can do that, flatten and ravel. A = rng.randint(0,5, (5,1)) A array([[2], [1], [4], [2], [4]]) A.flatten() array([2, 1, 4, 2, 4]) A.ravel() array([2, 1, 4, 2, 4]) So why two functions? I’m not sure, but they do different things behind the scenes. flatten creates a copy, i.e. a new array disconnected from A. ravel creates a view, so a representation of the original array. If you then changed a value after a ravel operation, you would also change it in the original array; if you did this after a flatten operation, you would not. 3.2.5 Broadcasting in Python Python deals with arrays in an interesting way, in terms of matching up dimensions of arrays for arithmetic operations. There are 3 rules: If two arrays differ in the number of dimensions, the shape of the smaller array is padded with 1s on its left side If the shape doesn’t match in any dimension, the array with shape = 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the others’ shape If in any dimension the sizes disagree and none of the sizes are 1, then an error is generated A = rng.normal(0,1,(4,5)) B = rng.normal(0,1,5) A.shape (4, 5) B.shape (5,) A - B array([[ 0.25410957, 1.89009891, -0.87300221, -0.17852271, -0.64735645], [ 0.72991872, 4.58821268, -0.03379553, -1.67352398, 1.43345867], [-1.51421293, 1.69993003, 1.81140727, -1.71622014, 0.52276992], [-1.30611819, 3.29767231, 0.91060221, 0.29490453, 1.24919619]]) B is 1-d, A is 2-d, so B’s shape is made into (1,5) (added to the left). Then it is repeated into 4 rows to make it’s shape (4,5), then the operation is performed. This means that we subtract the first element of B from the first column of A, the second element of B from the second column of A, and so on. You can be explicit about adding dimensions for broadcasting by using np.newaxis. B[np.newaxis,:].shape (1, 5) B[:,np.newaxis].shape (5, 1) 3.2.5.1 An example (optional, intermediate/advanced)) This can be very useful, since these operations are faster than for loops. For example: d = rng.random_sample((10,2)) d array([[0.9497432 , 0.22672332], [0.96319737, 0.61011348], [0.2542308 , 0.60550727], [0.64054935, 0.85273037], [0.19747218, 0.45957414], [0.41571736, 0.9902779 ], [0.33720945, 0.30637872], [0.15139082, 0.30126537], [0.72158605, 0.3560211 ], [0.86288412, 0.66608767]]) We want to find the Euclidean distance (the sum of squared differences) between the points defined by the rows. This should result in a 10x10 distance matrix d.shape (10, 2) d[np.newaxis,:,:] array([[[0.9497432 , 0.22672332], [0.96319737, 0.61011348], [0.2542308 , 0.60550727], [0.64054935, 0.85273037], [0.19747218, 0.45957414], [0.41571736, 0.9902779 ], [0.33720945, 0.30637872], [0.15139082, 0.30126537], [0.72158605, 0.3560211 ], [0.86288412, 0.66608767]]]) creates a 3-d array with the first dimension being of length 1 d[np.newaxis,:,:].shape (1, 10, 2) d[:, np.newaxis,:] array([[[0.9497432 , 0.22672332]], [[0.96319737, 0.61011348]], [[0.2542308 , 0.60550727]], [[0.64054935, 0.85273037]], [[0.19747218, 0.45957414]], [[0.41571736, 0.9902779 ]], [[0.33720945, 0.30637872]], [[0.15139082, 0.30126537]], [[0.72158605, 0.3560211 ]], [[0.86288412, 0.66608767]]]) creates a 3-d array with the 2nd dimension being of length 1 d[:,np.newaxis,:].shape (10, 1, 2) Now for the trick, using broadcasting of arrays. These two arrays are incompatible without broadcasting, but with broadcasting, the right things get repeated to make things compatible dist_sq = np.sum((d[:,np.newaxis,:] - d[np.newaxis,:,:]) ** 2) dist_sq.shape () dist_sq 29.512804540441067 Whoops! we wanted a 10x10 matrix, not a scalar. (d[:,np.newaxis,:] - d[np.newaxis,:,:]).shape (10, 10, 2) What we really want is the 10x10 distance matrix. dist_sq = np.sum((d[:,np.newaxis,:] - d[np.newaxis,:,:]) ** 2, axis=2) You can verify what is happening by creating D = d[:,np.newaxis,:]-d[np.newaxis,:,:] and then looking at D[:,:,0] and D[:,:,1]. These are the difference between each combination in the first and second columns of d, respectively. Squaring and summing along the 3rd axis then gives the sum of squared differences. dist_sq array([[0. , 0.14716903, 0.62721478, 0.48748566, 0.6201312 , 0.8681992 , 0.38154258, 0.64292305, 0.0687736 , 0.20058553], [0.14716903, 0. , 0.5026548 , 0.16296469, 0.60899716, 0.44425934, 0.48411568, 0.75441703, 0.12293897, 0.01319586], [0.62721478, 0.5026548 , 0. , 0.21036128, 0.02451802, 0.17412634, 0.09636334, 0.1031392 , 0.28066428, 0.37412884], [0.48748566, 0.16296469, 0.21036128, 0. , 0.35088921, 0.06946875, 0.39051522, 0.54338972, 0.25328705, 0.08426824], [0.6201312 , 0.60899716, 0.02451802, 0.35088921, 0. , 0.32927744, 0.04299534, 0.02718516, 0.28541859, 0.48542089], [0.8681992 , 0.44425934, 0.17412634, 0.06946875, 0.32927744, 0. , 0.47388157, 0.54460678, 0.49583735, 0.30505741], [0.38154258, 0.48411568, 0.09636334, 0.39051522, 0.04299534, 0.47388157, 0. , 0.03455471, 0.15020974, 0.40572438], [0.64292305, 0.75441703, 0.1031392 , 0.54338972, 0.02718516, 0.54460678, 0.03455471, 0. , 0.3281208 , 0.63931803], [0.0687736 , 0.12293897, 0.28066428, 0.25328705, 0.28541859, 0.49583735, 0.15020974, 0.3281208 , 0. , 0.11610642], [0.20058553, 0.01319586, 0.37412884, 0.08426824, 0.48542089, 0.30505741, 0.40572438, 0.63931803, 0.11610642, 0. ]]) dist_sq.shape (10, 10) dist_sq.diagonal() array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]) 3.2.6 Conclusions moving forward It’s important to understand numpy and arrays, since most data sets we encounter are rectangular. The notations and operations we saw in numpy will translate to data, except for the fact that data is typically heterogeneous, i.e., of different types. The problem with using numpy for modern data analysis is that if you have mixed data types, it will all be coerced to strings, and then you can’t actually do any data analysis. The solution to this issue (which is also present in Matlab) came about with the pandas package, which is the main workhorse of data science in Python "],

It allows for data ingestion, transformation and cleaning, and creates objects that can then be passed on to analytic packages like statsmodels and scikit-learn for modeling and packages like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualization. pandas is built on top of numpy, so many numpy functions are commonly used in manipulating pandas objects. pandas is a pretty extensive package, and we’ll only be able to cover some of its features. For more details, there is free online documentation at pandas.pydata.org. You can also look at the book “Python for Data Analysis (2nd edition)” by Wes McKinney, the original developer of the pandas package, for more details. 4.2 Starting pandas As with any Python module, you have to “activate” pandas by using import. The “standard” alias for pandas is pd. We will also import numpy, since pandas uses some numpy functions in the workflows. import numpy as np import pandas as pd 4.3 Data import and export Most data sets you will work with are set up in tables, so are rectangular in shape. Think Excel spreadsheets. In pandas the structure that will hold this kind of data is a DataFrame. We can read external data into a DataFrame using one of many read_* functions. We can also write from a DataFrame to a variety of formats using to_* functions. The most common of these are listed below: Format type Description reader writer text CSV read_csv to_csv Excel read_excel to_excel text JSON read_json to_json binary Feather read_feather to_feather binary SAS read_sas SQL SQL read_sql to_sql We’ll start by reading in the mtcars dataset stored as a CSV file pd.read_csv(&#39;data/mtcars.csv&#39;) make mpg cyl disp hp ... qsec vs am gear carb 0 Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 ... 16.46 0 1 4 4 1 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 ... 17.02 0 1 4 4 2 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 ... 18.61 1 1 4 1 3 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 ... 19.44 1 0 3 1 4 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 ... 17.02 0 0 3 2 5 Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 ... 20.22 1 0 3 1 6 Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 ... 15.84 0 0 3 4 7 Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 ... 20.00 1 0 4 2 8 Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 ... 22.90 1 0 4 2 9 Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 ... 18.30 1 0 4 4 10 Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 ... 18.90 1 0 4 4 11 Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 ... 17.40 0 0 3 3 12 Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 ... 17.60 0 0 3 3 13 Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 ... 18.00 0 0 3 3 14 Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 ... 17.98 0 0 3 4 15 Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 ... 17.82 0 0 3 4 16 Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 ... 17.42 0 0 3 4 17 Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 ... 19.47 1 1 4 1 18 Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 ... 18.52 1 1 4 2 19 Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 ... 19.90 1 1 4 1 20 Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 ... 20.01 1 0 3 1 21 Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 ... 16.87 0 0 3 2 22 AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 ... 17.30 0 0 3 2 23 Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 ... 15.41 0 0 3 4 24 Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 ... 17.05 0 0 3 2 25 Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 ... 18.90 1 1 4 1 26 Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 ... 16.70 0 1 5 2 27 Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 ... 16.90 1 1 5 2 28 Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 ... 14.50 0 1 5 4 29 Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 ... 15.50 0 1 5 6 30 Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 ... 14.60 0 1 5 8 31 Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 ... 18.60 1 1 4 2 [32 rows x 12 columns] This just prints out the data, but then it’s lost. To use this data, we have to give it a name, so it’s stored in Python’s memory mtcars = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/mtcars.csv&#39;) One of the big differences between a spreadsheet program and a programming language from the data science perspective is that you have to load data into the programming language. It’s not “just there” like Excel. This is a good thing, since it allows the common functionality of the programming language to work across multiple data sets, and also keeps the original data set pristine. Excel users can run into problems and corrupt their data if they are not careful. If we wanted to write this data set back out into an Excel file, say, we could do mtcars.to_excel(&#39;data/mtcars.xlsx&#39;) You may get an error if you don’t have the openpyxl package installed. You can easily install it from the Anaconda prompt using conda install openpyxl and following the prompts. 4.4 Exploring a data set We would like to get some idea about this data set. There are a bunch of functions linked to the DataFrame object that help us in this. First we will use head to see the first 8 rows of this data set mtcars.head(8) make mpg cyl disp hp ... qsec vs am gear carb 0 Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 ... 16.46 0 1 4 4 1 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 ... 17.02 0 1 4 4 2 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 ... 18.61 1 1 4 1 3 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 ... 19.44 1 0 3 1 4 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 ... 17.02 0 0 3 2 5 Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 ... 20.22 1 0 3 1 6 Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 ... 15.84 0 0 3 4 7 Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 ... 20.00 1 0 4 2 [8 rows x 12 columns] This is our first look into this data. We notice a few things. Each column has a name, and each row has an index, starting at 0. If you’re interested in the last N rows, there is a corresponding tail function Let’s look at the data types of each of the columns mtcars.dtypes make object mpg float64 cyl int64 disp float64 hp int64 drat float64 wt float64 qsec float64 vs int64 am int64 gear int64 carb int64 dtype: object This tells us that some of the variables, like mpg and disp, are floating point (decimal) numbers, several are integers, and make is an “object”. The dtypes function borrows from numpy, where there isn’t really a type for character or categorical variables. So most often, when you see “object” in the output of dtypes, you think it’s a character or categorical variable. We can also look at the data structure in a bit more detail. mtcars.info() &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 32 entries, 0 to 31 Data columns (total 12 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 make 32 non-null object 1 mpg 32 non-null float64 2 cyl 32 non-null int64 3 disp 32 non-null float64 4 hp 32 non-null int64 5 drat 32 non-null float64 6 wt 32 non-null float64 7 qsec 32 non-null float64 8 vs 32 non-null int64 9 am 32 non-null int64 10 gear 32 non-null int64 11 carb 32 non-null int64 dtypes: float64(5), int64(6), object(1) memory usage: 3.1+ KB This tells us that this is indeed a DataFrame, wth 12 columns, each with 32 valid observations. Each row has an index value ranging from 0 to 11. We also get the approximate size of this object in memory. You can also quickly find the number of rows and columns of a data set by using shape, which is borrowed from numpy. mtcars.shape (32, 12) More generally, we can get a summary of each variable using the describe function mtcars.describe() mpg cyl disp ... am gear carb count 32.000000 32.000000 32.000000 ... 32.000000 32.000000 32.0000 mean 20.090625 6.187500 230.721875 ... 0.406250 3.687500 2.8125 std 6.026948 1.785922 123.938694 ... 0.498991 0.737804 1.6152 min 10.400000 4.000000 71.100000 ... 0.000000 3.000000 1.0000 25% 15.425000 4.000000 120.825000 ... 0.000000 3.000000 2.0000 50% 19.200000 6.000000 196.300000 ... 0.000000 4.000000 2.0000 75% 22.800000 8.000000 326.000000 ... 1.000000 4.000000 4.0000 max 33.900000 8.000000 472.000000 ... 1.000000 5.000000 8.0000 [8 rows x 11 columns] These are usually the first steps in exploring the data. 4.5 Data structures and types pandas has two main data types: Series and DataFrame. These are analogous to vectors and matrices, in that a Series is 1-dimensional while a DataFrame is 2-dimensional. 4.5.1 pandas.Series The Series object holds data from a single input variable, and is required, much like numpy arrays, to be homogeneous in type. You can create Series objects from lists or numpy arrays quite easily s = pd.Series([1,3,5,np.nan, 9, 13]) s 0 1.0 1 3.0 2 5.0 3 NaN 4 9.0 5 13.0 dtype: float64 s2 = pd.Series(np.arange(1,20)) s2 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 17 17 18 18 19 dtype: int64 You can access elements of a Series much like a dict s2[4] 5 There is no requirement that the index of a Series has to be numeric. It can be any kind of scalar object s3 = pd.Series(np.random.normal(0,1, (5,)), index = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;e&#39;]) s3 a 0.291525 b 2.817628 c 1.022957 d -0.218105 e 0.602195 dtype: float64 s3[&#39;d&#39;] -0.21810503592521305 s3[&#39;a&#39;:&#39;d&#39;] a 0.291525 b 2.817628 c 1.022957 d -0.218105 dtype: float64 Well, slicing worked, but it gave us something different than expected. It gave us both the start and end of the slice, which is unlike what we’ve encountered so far!! It turns out that in pandas, slicing by index actually does this. It is a discrepancy from numpy and Python in general that we have to be careful about. You can extract the actual values into a numpy array s3.to_numpy() array([ 0.29152493, 2.81762816, 1.02295695, -0.21810504, 0.60219464]) In fact, you’ll see that much of pandas’ structures are build on top of numpy arrays. This is a good thing, since you can take advantage of the powerful numpy functions that are built for fast, efficient scientific computing. Making the point about slicing again, s3.to_numpy()[0:3] array([0.29152493, 2.81762816, 1.02295695]) This is different from index-based slicing done earlier. 4.5.2 pandas.DataFrame The DataFrame object holds a rectangular data set. Each column of a DataFrame is a Series object. This means that each column of a DataFrame must be comprised of data of the same type, but different columns can hold data of different types. This structure is extremely useful in practical data science. The invention of this structure was, in my opinion, transformative in making Python an effective data science tool. 4.5.2.1 Creating a DataFrame The DataFrame can be created by importing data, as we saw in the previous section. It can also be created by a few methods within Python. First, it can be created from a 2-dimensional numpy array. rng = np.random.RandomState(25) d1 = pd.DataFrame(rng.normal(0,1, (4,5))) d1 0 1 2 3 4 0 0.228273 1.026890 -0.839585 -0.591182 -0.956888 1 -0.222326 -0.619915 1.837905 -2.053231 0.868583 2 -0.920734 -0.232312 2.152957 -1.334661 0.076380 3 -1.246089 1.202272 -1.049942 1.056610 -0.419678 You will notice that it creates default column names, that are merely the column number, starting from 0. We can also create the column names and row index (similar to the Series index we saw earlier) directly during creation. d2 = pd.DataFrame(rng.normal(0,1, (4, 5)), columns = [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;D&#39;,&#39;E&#39;], index = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]) d2 A B C D E a 2.294842 -2.594487 2.822756 0.680889 -1.577693 b -1.976254 0.533340 -0.290870 -0.513520 1.982626 c 0.226001 -1.839905 1.607671 0.388292 0.399732 d 0.405477 0.217002 -0.633439 0.246622 -1.939546 We could also create a DataFrame from a list of lists, as long as things line up, just as we showed for numpy arrays. However, to me, other ways, including the dict method below, make more sense. We can change the column names (which can be extracted and replaced with the columns attribute) and the index values (using the index attribute). d2.columns Index([&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;E&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) d2.columns = pd.Index([&#39;V&#39;+str(i) for i in range(1,6)]) # Index creates the right objects for both column names and row names, which can be extracted and changed with the `index` attribute d2 V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 a 2.294842 -2.594487 2.822756 0.680889 -1.577693 b -1.976254 0.533340 -0.290870 -0.513520 1.982626 c 0.226001 -1.839905 1.607671 0.388292 0.399732 d 0.405477 0.217002 -0.633439 0.246622 -1.939546 Exercise: Can you explain what I did in the list comprehension above? The key points are understanding str and how I constructed the range. d2.index = [&#39;o1&#39;,&#39;o2&#39;,&#39;o3&#39;,&#39;o4&#39;] d2 V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 o1 2.294842 -2.594487 2.822756 0.680889 -1.577693 o2 -1.976254 0.533340 -0.290870 -0.513520 1.982626 o3 0.226001 -1.839905 1.607671 0.388292 0.399732 o4 0.405477 0.217002 -0.633439 0.246622 -1.939546 You can also extract data from a homogeneous DataFrame to a numpy array d1.to_numpy() array([[ 0.22827309, 1.0268903 , -0.83958485, -0.59118152, -0.9568883 ], [-0.22232569, -0.61991511, 1.83790458, -2.05323076, 0.86858305], [-0.92073444, -0.23231186, 2.1529569 , -1.33466147, 0.07637965], [-1.24608928, 1.20227231, -1.04994158, 1.05661011, -0.41967767]]) It turns out that you can use to_numpy for a non-homogeneous DataFrame as well. numpy just makes it homogeneous by assigning each column the data type object. This also limits what you can do in numpy with the array and may require changing data types using the astype function. There is some more detail about the object data type in the Python Tools for Data Science (notebook, PDF) document. The other easy way to create a DataFrame is from a dict object, where each component object is either a list or a numpy array, and is homogeneous in type. One exception is if a component is of size 1; then it is repeated to meet the needs of the DataFrame’s dimensions df = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;A&#39;:3., &#39;B&#39;:rng.random_sample(5), &#39;C&#39;: pd.Timestamp(&#39;20200512&#39;), &#39;D&#39;: np.array([6] * 5), &#39;E&#39;: pd.Categorical([&#39;yes&#39;,&#39;no&#39;,&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;,&#39;no&#39;]), &#39;F&#39;: &#39;NIH&#39;}) df A B C D E F 0 3.0 0.958092 2020-05-12 6 yes NIH 1 3.0 0.883201 2020-05-12 6 no NIH 2 3.0 0.295432 2020-05-12 6 no NIH 3 3.0 0.512376 2020-05-12 6 yes NIH 4 3.0 0.088702 2020-05-12 6 no NIH df.info() &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 5 entries, 0 to 4 Data columns (total 6 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 A 5 non-null float64 1 B 5 non-null float64 2 C 5 non-null datetime64[ns] 3 D 5 non-null int64 4 E 5 non-null category 5 F 5 non-null object dtypes: category(1), datetime64[ns](1), float64(2), int64(1), object(1) memory usage: 429.0+ bytes We note that C is a date object, E is a category object, and F is a text/string object. pandas has excellent time series capabilities (having origins in FinTech), and the TimeStamp function creates datetime objects which can be queried and manipulated in Python. We’ll describe category data in the next section. You can also create a DataFrame where each column is composed of composite objects, like lists and dicts, as well. This might have limited value in some settings, but may be useful in others. In particular, this allows capabilities like the list-column construct in R tibbles. For example, pd.DataFrame({&#39;list&#39; :[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], &#39;tuple&#39; : [(&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;), (&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;), (&#39;e&#39;,&#39;f&#39;)], &#39;set&#39; : [{&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;}, {&#39;D&#39;,&#39;E&#39;}, {&#39;F&#39;}], &#39;dicts&#39; : [{&#39;A&#39;: [1,2,3]}, {&#39;B&#39;:[5,6,8]}, {&#39;C&#39;: [3,9]}]}) list tuple set dicts 0 [1, 2] (a, b) {B, C, A} {&#39;A&#39;: [1, 2, 3]} 1 [3, 4] (c, d) {D, E} {&#39;B&#39;: [5, 6, 8]} 2 [5, 6] (e, f) {F} {&#39;C&#39;: [3, 9]} 4.5.2.2 Working with a DataFrame You can extract particular columns of a DataFrame by name df[&#39;E&#39;] 0 yes 1 no 2 no 3 yes 4 no Name: E, dtype: category Categories (2, object): [no, yes] df[&#39;B&#39;] 0 0.958092 1 0.883201 2 0.295432 3 0.512376 4 0.088702 Name: B, dtype: float64 There is also a shortcut for accessing single columns, using Python’s dot (.) notation. df.B 0 0.958092 1 0.883201 2 0.295432 3 0.512376 4 0.088702 Name: B, dtype: float64 This notation can be more convenient if we need to perform operations on a single column. If we want to extract multiple columns, this notation will not work. Also, if we want to create new columns or replace existing columns, we need to use the array notation with the column name in quotes. Let’s look at slicing a DataFrame 4.5.2.3 Extracting rows and columns There are two extractor functions in pandas: loc extracts by label (index label, column label, slice of labels, etc. iloc extracts by index (integers, slice objects, etc. df2 = pd.DataFrame(rng.randint(0,10, (5,4)), index = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;e&#39;], columns = [&#39;one&#39;,&#39;two&#39;,&#39;three&#39;,&#39;four&#39;]) df2 one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 d 5 2 7 1 e 6 7 8 7 First, let’s see what naively slicing this DataFrame does. df2[&#39;one&#39;] a 5 b 9 c 8 d 5 e 6 Name: one, dtype: int64 Ok, that works. It grabs one column from the dataset. How about the dot notation? df2.one a 5 b 9 c 8 d 5 e 6 Name: one, dtype: int64 Let’s see what this produces. type(df2.one) &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.series.Series&#39;&gt; So this is a series, so we can potentially do slicing of this series. df2.one[&#39;b&#39;] 9 df2.one[&#39;b&#39;:&#39;d&#39;] b 9 c 8 d 5 Name: one, dtype: int64 df2.one[:3] a 5 b 9 c 8 Name: one, dtype: int64 Ok, so we have all the Series slicing available. The problem here is in semantics, in that we are grabbing one column and then slicing the rows. That doesn’t quite work with our sense that a DataFrame is a rectangle with rows and columns, and we tend to think of rows, then columns. Let’s see if we can do column slicing with this. df2[:&#39;two&#39;] one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 d 5 2 7 1 e 6 7 8 7 That’s not what we want, of course. It’s giving back the entire data frame. We’ll come back to this. df2[[&#39;one&#39;,&#39;three&#39;]] one three a 5 2 b 9 0 c 8 3 d 5 7 e 6 8 That works correctly though. We can give a list of column names. Ok. How about row slices? #df2[&#39;a&#39;] # Doesn&#39;t work df2[&#39;a&#39;:&#39;c&#39;] one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 Ok, that works. It slices rows, but includes the largest index, like a Series but unlike numpy arrays. df2[0:2] one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 Slices by location work too, but use the numpy slicing rules. This entire extraction method becomes confusing. Let’s simplify things for this, and then move on to more consistent ways to extract elements of a DataFrame. Let’s agree on two things. If we’re going the direct extraction route, We will extract single columns of a DataFrame with [] or ., i.e., df2['one'] or df2.one We will extract slices of rows of a DataFrame using location only, i.e., df2[:3]. For everything else, we’ll use two functions, loc and iloc. loc extracts elements like a matrix, using index and columns iloc extracts elements like a matrix, using location df2.loc[:,&#39;one&#39;:&#39;three&#39;] one two three a 5 3 2 b 9 3 0 c 8 4 3 d 5 2 7 e 6 7 8 df2.loc[&#39;a&#39;:&#39;d&#39;,:] one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 d 5 2 7 1 df2.loc[&#39;b&#39;, &#39;three&#39;] 0 So loc works just like a matrix, but with pandas slicing rules (include largest index) df2.iloc[:,1:4] two three four a 3 2 8 b 3 0 5 c 4 3 3 d 2 7 1 e 7 8 7 df2.iloc[1:3,:] one two three four b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 df2.iloc[1:3, 1:4] two three four b 3 0 5 c 4 3 3 iloc slices like a matrix, but uses numpy slicing conventions (does not include highest index) 4.5.2.3.1 Boolean selection We can also use tests to extract data from a DataFrame. For example, we can extract only rows where column labeled one is greater than 3. df2[df2.one &gt; 3] one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 d 5 2 7 1 e 6 7 8 7 We can also do composite tests. Here we ask for rows where one is greater than 3 and three is less than 9 df2[(df2.one &gt; 3) &amp; (df2.three &lt; 9)] one two three four a 5 3 2 8 b 9 3 0 5 c 8 4 3 3 d 5 2 7 1 e 6 7 8 7 4.5.2.3.2 query DataFrame’s have a query method allowing selection using a Python expression n = 10 df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(n, 3), columns = list(&#39;abc&#39;)) df a b c 0 0.911518 0.774025 0.842822 1 0.262770 0.942353 0.160558 2 0.413649 0.048246 0.416981 3 0.541607 0.197460 0.047763 4 0.032024 0.222693 0.850371 5 0.924391 0.496817 0.528381 6 0.605526 0.267757 0.737004 7 0.257142 0.155081 0.215106 8 0.976081 0.072852 0.632117 9 0.350240 0.042772 0.367181 df[(df.a &lt; df.b) &amp; (df.b &lt; df.c)] a b c 4 0.032024 0.222693 0.850371 We can equivalently write this query as df.query(&#39;(a &lt; b) &amp; (b &lt; c)&#39;) a b c 4 0.032024 0.222693 0.850371 4.5.3 Categorical data pandas provides a Categorical function and a category object type to Python. This type is analogous to the factor data type in R. It is meant to address categorical or discrete variables, where we need to use them in analyses. Categorical variables typically take on a small number of unique values, like gender, blood type, country of origin, race, etc. You can create categorical Series in a couple of ways: s = pd.Series([&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;], dtype=&#39;category&#39;) df = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;A&#39;:3., &#39;B&#39;:rng.random_sample(5), &#39;C&#39;: pd.Timestamp(&#39;20200512&#39;), &#39;D&#39;: np.array([6] * 5), &#39;E&#39;: pd.Categorical([&#39;yes&#39;,&#39;no&#39;,&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;,&#39;no&#39;]), &#39;F&#39;: &#39;NIH&#39;}) df[&#39;F&#39;].astype(&#39;category&#39;) 0 NIH 1 NIH 2 NIH 3 NIH 4 NIH Name: F, dtype: category Categories (1, object): [NIH] You can also create DataFrame’s where each column is categorical df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;A&#39;: list(&#39;abcd&#39;), &#39;B&#39;: list(&#39;bdca&#39;)}) df_cat = df.astype(&#39;category&#39;) df_cat.dtypes A category B category dtype: object You can explore categorical data in a variety of ways df_cat[&#39;A&#39;].describe() count 4 unique 4 top d freq 1 Name: A, dtype: object df[&#39;A&#39;].value_counts() c 1 b 1 a 1 d 1 Name: A, dtype: int64 One issue with categories is that, if a particular level of a category is not seen before, it can create an error. So you can pre-specify the categories you expect df_cat[&#39;B&#39;] = pd.Categorical(list(&#39;aabb&#39;), categories = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]) df_cat[&#39;B&#39;].value_counts() b 2 a 2 d 0 c 0 Name: B, dtype: int64 4.5.4 Missing data Both numpy and pandas allow for missing values, which are a reality in data science. The missing values are coded as np.nan. Let’s create some data and force some missing values df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5, 3), index = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;,&#39;g&#39;], columns = [&#39;one&#39;,&#39;two&#39;,&#39;three&#39;]) # pre-specify index and column names df[&#39;four&#39;] = 20 # add a column named &quot;four&quot;, which will all be 20 df[&#39;five&#39;] = df[&#39;one&#39;] &gt; 0 df one two three four five a 0.430267 -2.734428 -1.167957 20 True c -0.501799 -0.527345 -0.795400 20 False e -0.777844 -1.076087 -0.964476 20 False f 0.488262 -1.117696 -1.114362 20 True g -1.702229 1.225061 2.119285 20 False df2 = df.reindex([&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;f&#39;,&#39;g&#39;]) df2.style.applymap(lambda x: &#39;background-color:yellow&#39;, subset = pd.IndexSlice[[&#39;b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;],:]) &lt;pandas.io.formats.style.Styler object at 0x121419d60&gt; The code above is creating new blank rows based on the new index values, some of which are present in the existing data and some of which are missing. We can create masks of the data indicating where missing values reside in a data set. df2.isna() one two three four five a False False False False False b True True True True True c False False False False False d True True True True True e False False False False False f False False False False False g False False False False False df2[&#39;one&#39;].notna() a True b False c True d False e True f True g True Name: one, dtype: bool We can obtain complete data by dropping any row that has any missing value. This is called complete case analysis, and you should be very careful using it. It is only valid if we belive that the missingness is missing at random, and not related to some characteristic of the data or the data gathering process. df2.dropna(how=&#39;any&#39;) one two three four five a 0.430267 -2.734428 -1.167957 20.0 True c -0.501799 -0.527345 -0.795400 20.0 False e -0.777844 -1.076087 -0.964476 20.0 False f 0.488262 -1.117696 -1.114362 20.0 True g -1.702229 1.225061 2.119285 20.0 False You can also fill in, or impute, missing values. This can be done using a single value.. out1 = df2.fillna(value = 5) out1.style.applymap(lambda x: &#39;background-color:yellow&#39;, subset = pd.IndexSlice[[&#39;b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;],:]) &lt;pandas.io.formats.style.Styler object at 0x1217faf70&gt; or a computed value like a column mean df3 = df2.copy() df3 = df3.select_dtypes(exclude=[object]) # remove non-numeric columns out2 = df3.fillna(df3.mean()) # df3.mean() computes column-wise means out2.style.applymap(lambda x: &#39;background-color:yellow&#39;, subset = pd.IndexSlice[[&#39;b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;],:]) &lt;pandas.io.formats.style.Styler object at 0x1217f3790&gt; You can also impute based on the principle of last value carried forward which is common in time series. This means that the missing value is imputed with the previous recorded value. out3 = df2.fillna(method = &#39;ffill&#39;) # Fill forward out3.style.applymap(lambda x: &#39;background-color:yellow&#39;, subset = pd.IndexSlice[[&#39;b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;],:]) &lt;pandas.io.formats.style.Styler object at 0x1218195b0&gt; out4 = df2.fillna(method = &#39;bfill&#39;) # Fill backward out4.style.applymap(lambda x: &#39;background-color:yellow&#39;, subset = pd.IndexSlice[[&#39;b&#39;,&#39;d&#39;],:]) &lt;pandas.io.formats.style.Styler object at 0x121818400&gt; 4.6 Data transformation 4.6.1 Arithmetic operations If you have a Series or DataFrame that is all numeric, you can add or multiply single numbers to all the elements together.

They are literally stacked, as is evidenced by the index values being repeated. This same exercise can be done by the append function df1.append(df2).append(df3) A B C D 0 a0 b0 c0 d0 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 0 a4 b4 c4 d4 1 a5 b5 c5 d5 2 a6 b6 c6 d6 3 a7 b7 c7 d7 0 a8 b8 c8 d8 1 a9 b9 c9 d9 2 a10 b10 c10 d10 3 a11 b11 c11 d11 Suppose we want to append a new row to df1. Lets create a new row. new_row = pd.Series([&#39;n1&#39;,&#39;n2&#39;,&#39;n3&#39;,&#39;n4&#39;]) pd.concat([df1, new_row]) A B C D 0 0 a0 b0 c0 d0 NaN 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 NaN 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 NaN 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 NaN 0 NaN NaN NaN NaN n1 1 NaN NaN NaN NaN n2 2 NaN NaN NaN NaN n3 3 NaN NaN NaN NaN n4 That’s a lot of missing values. The issue is that the we don’t have column names in the new_row, and the indices are the same, so pandas tries to append it my making a new column. The solution is to make it a DataFrame. new_row = pd.DataFrame([[&#39;n1&#39;,&#39;n2&#39;,&#39;n3&#39;,&#39;n4&#39;]], columns = [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;D&#39;]) print(new_row) A B C D 0 n1 n2 n3 n4 pd.concat([df1, new_row]) A B C D 0 a0 b0 c0 d0 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 0 n1 n2 n3 n4 or df1.append(new_row) A B C D 0 a0 b0 c0 d0 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 0 n1 n2 n3 n4 4.6.2.1 Adding columns pd.concat([df1,df2,df3], axis = 1) A B C D A B C D A B C D 0 a0 b0 c0 d0 a4 b4 c4 d4 a8 b8 c8 d8 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 a5 b5 c5 d5 a9 b9 c9 d9 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 a6 b6 c6 d6 a10 b10 c10 d10 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 a7 b7 c7 d7 a11 b11 c11 d11 The option axis=1 ensures that concatenation happens by columns. The default value axis = 0 concatenates by rows. Let’s play a little game. Let’s change the column names of df2 and df3 so they are not the same as df1. df2.columns = [&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;H&#39;] df3.columns = [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;D&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;H&#39;] pd.concat([df1,df2,df3]) A B C D E F G H 0 a0 b0 c0 d0 NaN NaN NaN NaN 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 NaN NaN NaN NaN 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 NaN NaN NaN NaN 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 NaN NaN NaN NaN 0 NaN NaN NaN NaN a4 b4 c4 d4 1 NaN NaN NaN NaN a5 b5 c5 d5 2 NaN NaN NaN NaN a6 b6 c6 d6 3 NaN NaN NaN NaN a7 b7 c7 d7 0 a8 NaN NaN b8 NaN c8 NaN d8 1 a9 NaN NaN b9 NaN c9 NaN d9 2 a10 NaN NaN b10 NaN c10 NaN d10 3 a11 NaN NaN b11 NaN c11 NaN d11 Now pandas ensures that all column names are represented in the new data frame, but with missing values where the row indices and column indices are mismatched. Some of this can be avoided by only joining on common columns. This is done using the join option ir concat. The default value is ’outer`, which is what you see. above pd.concat([df1, df3], join = &#39;inner&#39;) A D 0 a0 d0 1 a1 d1 2 a2 d2 3 a3 d3 0 a8 b8 1 a9 b9 2 a10 b10 3 a11 b11 You can do the same thing when joining by rows, using axis = 0 and join=\"inner\" to only join on rows with matching indices. Reminder that the indices are just labels and happen to be the row numbers by default. 4.6.3 Merging data sets For this section we’ll use a set of data from a survey, also used by Daniel Chen in “Pandas for Everyone” person = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/survey_person.csv&#39;) site = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/survey_site.csv&#39;) survey = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/survey_survey.csv&#39;) visited = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/survey_visited.csv&#39;) print(person) ident personal family 0 dyer William Dyer 1 pb Frank Pabodie 2 lake Anderson Lake 3 roe Valentina Roerich 4 danforth Frank Danforth print(site) name lat long 0 DR-1 -49.85 -128.57 1 DR-3 -47.15 -126.72 2 MSK-4 -48.87 -123.40 print(survey) taken person quant reading 0 619 dyer rad 9.82 1 619 dyer sal 0.13 2 622 dyer rad 7.80 3 622 dyer sal 0.09 4 734 pb rad 8.41 5 734 lake sal 0.05 6 734 pb temp -21.50 7 735 pb rad 7.22 8 735 NaN sal 0.06 9 735 NaN temp -26.00 10 751 pb rad 4.35 11 751 pb temp -18.50 12 751 lake sal 0.10 13 752 lake rad 2.19 14 752 lake sal 0.09 15 752 lake temp -16.00 16 752 roe sal 41.60 17 837 lake rad 1.46 18 837 lake sal 0.21 19 837 roe sal 22.50 20 844 roe rad 11.25 print(visited) ident site dated 0 619 DR-1 1927-02-08 1 622 DR-1 1927-02-10 2 734 DR-3 1939-01-07 3 735 DR-3 1930-01-12 4 751 DR-3 1930-02-26 5 752 DR-3 NaN 6 837 MSK-4 1932-01-14 7 844 DR-1 1932-03-22 There are basically four kinds of joins: pandas R SQL Description left left_join left outer keep all rows on left right right_join right outer keep all rows on right outer outer_join full outer keep all rows from both inner inner_join inner keep only rows with common keys The terms left and right refer to which data set you call first and second respectively.

Since we’re doing a left join, we keed all the rows from survey and add columns from visited, matching on the common key, called “taken” in one dataset and “ident” in the other. Note that the rows of visited are repeated as needed to line up with all the rows with common “taken” values.

Tidy data is a structure for datasets to make them more easily analyzed on computers. The basic principles are Each row is an observation Each column is a variable Each type of observational unit forms a table Tidy data is tidy in one way. Untidy data can be untidy in many ways Let’s look at some examples. from glob import glob filenames = sorted(glob(&#39;data/table*.csv&#39;)) # find files matching pattern. I know there are 6 of them table1, table2, table3, table4a, table4b, table5 = [pd.read_csv(f) for f in filenames] # Use a list comprehension This code imports data from 6 files matching a pattern. Python allows multiple assignments on the left of the =, and as each dataset is imported, it gets assigned in order to the variables on the left. In the second line I sort the file names so that they match the order in which I’m storing them in the 3rd line. The function glob does pattern-matching of file names. The following tables refer to the number of TB cases and population in Afghanistan, Brazil and China in 1999 and 2000 print(table1) country year cases population 0 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 1 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 2 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 3 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 4 China 1999 212258 1272915272 5 China 2000 213766 1280428583 print(table2) country year type count 0 Afghanistan 1999 cases 745 1 Afghanistan 1999 population 19987071 2 Afghanistan 2000 cases 2666 3 Afghanistan 2000 population 20595360 4 Brazil 1999 cases 37737 5 Brazil 1999 population 172006362 6 Brazil 2000 cases 80488 7 Brazil 2000 population 174504898 8 China 1999 cases 212258 9 China 1999 population 1272915272 10 China 2000 cases 213766 11 China 2000 population 1280428583 print(table3) country year rate 0 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 1 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 2 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 3 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 4 China 1999 212258/1272915272 5 China 2000 213766/1280428583 print(table4a) # cases country 1999 2000 0 Afghanistan 745 2666 1 Brazil 37737 80488 2 China 212258 213766 print(table4b) # population country 1999 2000 0 Afghanistan 19987071 20595360 1 Brazil 172006362 174504898 2 China 1272915272 1280428583 print(table5) country century year rate 0 Afghanistan 19 99 745/19987071 1 Afghanistan 20 0 2666/20595360 2 Brazil 19 99 37737/172006362 3 Brazil 20 0 80488/174504898 4 China 19 99 212258/1272915272 5 China 20 0 213766/1280428583 Exercise: Describe why and why not each of these datasets are tidy. 4.6.5 Melting (unpivoting) data Melting is the operation of collapsing multiple columns into 2 columns, where one column is formed by the old column names, and the other by the corresponding values. Some columns may be kept fixed and their data are repeated to maintain the interrelationships between the variables. We’ll start with loading some data on income and religion in the US from the Pew Research Center. pew = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/pew.csv&#39;) print(pew.head()) religion &lt;$10k $10-20k ... $100-150k &gt;150k Don&#39;t know/refused 0 Agnostic 27 34 ... 109 84 96 1 Atheist 12 27 ... 59 74 76 2 Buddhist 27 21 ... 39 53 54 3 Catholic 418 617 ... 792 633 1489 4 Don’t know/refused 15 14 ... 17 18 116 [5 rows x 11 columns] This dataset is considered in “wide” format. There are several issues with it, including the fact that column headers have data. Those column headers are income groups, that should be a column by tidy principles. Our job is to turn this dataset into “long” format with a column for income group. We will use the function melt to achieve this. This takes a few parameters: id_vars is a list of variables that will remain as is value_vars is a list of column nmaes that we will melt (or unpivot). By default, it will melt all columns not mentioned in id_vars var_name is a string giving the name of the new column created by the headers (default: variable) value_name is a string giving the name of the new column created by the values (default: value) pew_long = pew.melt(id_vars = [&#39;religion&#39;], var_name = &#39;income_group&#39;, value_name = &#39;count&#39;) print(pew_long.head()) religion income_group count 0 Agnostic &lt;$10k 27 1 Atheist &lt;$10k 12 2 Buddhist &lt;$10k 27 3 Catholic &lt;$10k 418 4 Don’t know/refused &lt;$10k 15 4.6.6 Separating columns containing multiple variables We will use an Ebola dataset to illustrate this principle ebola = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/country_timeseries.csv&#39;) print(ebola.head()) Date Day ... Deaths_Spain Deaths_Mali 0 1/5/2015 289 ... NaN NaN 1 1/4/2015 288 ... NaN NaN 2 1/3/2015 287 ... NaN NaN 3 1/2/2015 286 ... NaN NaN 4 12/31/2014 284 ... NaN NaN [5 rows x 18 columns] Note that for each country we have two columns – one for cases (number infected) and one for deaths. Ideally we want one column for country, one for cases and one for deaths. The first step will be to melt this data sets so that the column headers in question from a column and the corresponding data forms a second column. ebola_long = ebola.melt(id_vars = [&#39;Date&#39;,&#39;Day&#39;]) print(ebola_long.head()) Date Day variable value 0 1/5/2015 289 Cases_Guinea 2776.0 1 1/4/2015 288 Cases_Guinea 2775.0 2 1/3/2015 287 Cases_Guinea 2769.0 3 1/2/2015 286 Cases_Guinea NaN 4 12/31/2014 284 Cases_Guinea 2730.0 We now need to split the data in the variable column to make two columns. One will contain the country name and the other either Cases or Deaths. We will use some string manipulation functions that we will see later to achieve this. variable_split = ebola_long[&#39;variable&#39;].str.split(&#39;_&#39;, expand=True) # split on the `_` character print(variable_split[:5]) 0 1 0 Cases Guinea 1 Cases Guinea 2 Cases Guinea 3 Cases Guinea 4 Cases Guinea The expand=True option forces the creation of an DataFrame rather than a list type(variable_split) &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; We can now concatenate this to the original data variable_split.columns = [&#39;status&#39;,&#39;country&#39;] ebola_parsed = pd.concat([ebola_long, variable_split], axis = 1) ebola_parsed.drop(&#39;variable&#39;, axis = 1, inplace=True) # Remove the column named &quot;variable&quot; and replace the old data with the new one in the same location print(ebola_parsed.head()) Date Day value status country 0 1/5/2015 289 2776.0 Cases Guinea 1 1/4/2015 288 2775.0 Cases Guinea 2 1/3/2015 287 2769.0 Cases Guinea 3 1/2/2015 286 NaN Cases Guinea 4 12/31/2014 284 2730.0 Cases Guinea 4.6.7 Pivot/spread datasets If we wanted to, we could also make two columns based on cases and deaths, so for each country and date you could easily read off the cases and deaths. This is achieved using the pivot_table function. In the pivot_table syntax, index refers to the columns we don’t want to change, columns refers to the column whose values will form the column names of the new columns, and values is the name of the column that will form the values in the pivoted dataset. ebola_parsed.pivot_table(index = [&#39;Date&#39;,&#39;Day&#39;, &#39;country&#39;], columns = &#39;status&#39;, values = &#39;value&#39;) status Cases Deaths Date Day country 1/2/2015 286 Liberia 8157.0 3496.0 1/3/2015 287 Guinea 2769.0 1767.0 Liberia 8166.0 3496.0 SierraLeone 9722.0 2915.0 1/4/2015 288 Guinea 2775.0 1781.0 ... ... ... 9/7/2014 169 Liberia 2081.0 1137.0 Nigeria 21.0 8.0 Senegal 3.0 0.0 SierraLeone 1424.0 524.0 9/9/2014 171 Liberia 2407.0 NaN [375 rows x 2 columns] This creates something called MultiIndex in the pandas DataFrame. This is useful in some advanced cases, but here, we just want a normal DataFrame back. We can achieve that by using the reset_index function. ebola_parsed.pivot_table(index = [&#39;Date&#39;,&#39;Day&#39;,&#39;country&#39;], columns = &#39;status&#39;, values = &#39;value&#39;).reset_index() status Date Day country Cases Deaths 0 1/2/2015 286 Liberia 8157.0 3496.0 1 1/3/2015 287 Guinea 2769.0 1767.0 2 1/3/2015 287 Liberia 8166.0 3496.0 3 1/3/2015 287 SierraLeone 9722.0 2915.0 4 1/4/2015 288 Guinea 2775.0 1781.0 .. ... ... ... ... ... 370 9/7/2014 169 Liberia 2081.0 1137.0 371 9/7/2014 169 Nigeria 21.0 8.0 372 9/7/2014 169 Senegal 3.0 0.0 373 9/7/2014 169 SierraLeone 1424.0 524.0 374 9/9/2014 171 Liberia 2407.0 NaN [375 rows x 5 columns] Pivoting is a 2-column to many-column operation, with the number of columns formed depending on the number of unique values present in the column of the original data that is entered into the columns argument of pivot_table Exercise: Load the file weather.csv into Python and work on making it a tidy dataset. It requires melting and pivoting. The dataset comprises of the maximun and minimum temperatures recorded each day in 2010. There are lots of missing value. Ultimately we want columns for days of the month, maximum temperature and minimum tempearture along with the location ID, the year and the month. 4.7 Data aggregation and split-apply-combine We’ll use the Gapminder dataset for this section df = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/gapminder.tsv&#39;, sep = &#39;\\t&#39;) # data is tab-separated, so we use `\\t` to specify that The paradigm we will be exploring is often called split-apply-combine or MapReduce or grouped aggregation. The basic idea is that you split a data set up by some feature, apply a recipe to each piece, compute the result, and then put the results back together into a dataset. This can be described in teh following schematic. pandas is set up for this. It features the groupby function that allows the “split” part of the operation. We can then apply a function to each part and put it back together. Let’s see how. df.head() country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap 0 Afghanistan Asia 1952 28.801 8425333 779.445314 1 Afghanistan Asia 1957 30.332 9240934 820.853030 2 Afghanistan Asia 1962 31.997 10267083 853.100710 3 Afghanistan Asia 1967 34.020 11537966 836.197138 4 Afghanistan Asia 1972 36.088 13079460 739.981106 f&quot;This dataset has {len(df[&#39;country&#39;].unique())} countries in it&quot; &#39;This dataset has 142 countries in it&#39; One of the variables in this dataset is life expectancy at birth, lifeExp. Suppose we want to find the average life expectancy of each country over the period of study. df.groupby(&#39;country&#39;)[&#39;lifeExp&#39;].mean() country Afghanistan 37.478833 Albania 68.432917 Algeria 59.030167 Angola 37.883500 Argentina 69.060417 ...

First, we use the groupby function, telling pandas to split the dataset up by values of the column country. df.groupby(&#39;country&#39;) &lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x1217fa820&gt; pandas won’t show you the actual data, but will tell you that it is a grouped dataframe object.

Humans are mainly visual creatures, and data visualization provides an opportunity to enhance communication of the story within the data. Often we find that data and the data-generating process is complex, and a visual representation of the data and our innate ability at pattern recognition can help reveal the complexities in a cognitively accessible way. 5.1.1 An example gallery Data visualization has a long and storied history, from Florence Nightangle onwards. Dr. Nightangle was a pioneer in data visualization and developed the rose plot to represent causes of death in hospitals during the Crimean War. John Snow, in 1854, famously visualized the cholera outbreak in London, which showed the geographic proximity of cholera prevalence with particular water wells. In one of the more famous visualizations, considered by many to be an optimal use of display ink and space, Minard visualized Napoleon’s disastrous campaign to Russia In more recent times, an employee at Facebook visualized all connections between users across the world, which clearly showed geographical associations with particular countries and regions. 5.1.2 Why visualize data? We often rely on numerical summaries to help understand and distinguish datasets. In 1973, Anscombe published an influential set of 4 datasets, each with two variables and with the means, variances and correlations being identical. When you graphed these data, the differences in the datasets were clearly visible. This set is popularly known as Anscombe’s quartet. A more recent experiment in data construction by Matejka and Fitzmaurice (2017) started with a representation of a dinosaur and created 10 more bivariate datasets which all shared the same univariate means and variances and the same pairwise correlations. These examples clarify the need for visualization to better understand relationships between variables. Even when using statistical visualization techniques, one has to be careful. Not all visualizations can discriminate between statistical characteristics. This was also explored by Matejka and Fitzmaurice. Strip plot Boxplot Violin plot 5.1.3 Conceptual ideas 5.1.3.1 Begin with the consumer in mind You have a deep understanding of the data you’re presenting The person seeing the visualization doesn’t Develop simpler visualizations first that are easier to explain 5.1.3.2 Tell a story Make sure the graphic is clear Make sure the main point you want to make “pops” 5.1.3.3 A matter of perception Color (including awareness of color deficiencies) Shape Fonts 5.1.3.4 Some principles Data-ink ratio No mental gymnastics The graphic should be self-evident Context should be clear Is a graph the wrong choice? Focus on the consumer See my slides for some more opinionated ideas 5.2 Plotting in Python Let’s take a very quick tour before we get into the weeds. We’ll use the mtcars dataset as an exemplar dataset that we can import using pandas import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.set_context(&#39;talk&#39;) sns.set_style(&#39;white&#39;, {&#39;font.family&#39;:&#39;Futura&#39;, &#39;text.color&#39;:&#39;1&#39;}) mtcars = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/mtcars.csv&#39;) 5.2.1 Static plots We will demonstrate plotting in what I’ll call the matplotlib ecosystem. matplotlib is the venerable and powerful visualization package that was originally designed to emulate the Matlab plotting paradigm. It has since evolved and as become a bit more user-friendly. It is still quite granular and can facilitate a lot of custom plots once you become familiar with it. However, as a starting point, I think it’s a bit much. We’ll see a bit of what it can offer later. We will consider two other options which are built on top of matplotlib, but are much more accessible. These are pandas and seaborn. The two packages have some different approaches, but both wrap matplotlib in higher-level code and decent choices so we don’t need to get into the matplotlib trenches quite so much. We’ll still call matplotlib in our code, since both these packages need it for some fine tuning. Both packages are also very much aligned to the DataFrame construct in pandas, so makes plotting a much more seamless experience. mtcars.plot.scatter(x = &#39;hp&#39;, y = &#39;mpg&#39;); plt.show() # mtcars.plot(x = &#39;hp&#39;, y = &#39;mpg&#39;, kind = &#39;scatter&#39;); sns.scatterplot(data = mtcars, x = &#39;hp&#39;, y = &#39;mpg&#39;); plt.show() There are of course some other choices based on your background and preferences. For static plots, there are a couple of emulators of the popular R package ggplot2. These are plotnine and ggplot. plotnine seems a bit more developed and uses the ggplot2 semantics of aesthetics and layers, with almost identical code syntax. You can install plotnine using conda: conda install -c conda-forge plotnine from plotnine import * (ggplot(mtcars) + aes(x = &#39;hp&#39;, y = &#39;mpg&#39;) + geom_point()) &lt;ggplot: (303618160)&gt; 5.2.2 Dynamic or interactive plots There are several Python packages that wrap around Javascript plotting libraries that are so popular in web-based graphics like D3 and Vega. Three that deserve mention are plotly, bokeh, and altair. If you actually want to experience the interactivity of the plots, please use the “Live notebooks” link in Canvas to run these notebooks. Otherwise, you can download the notebooks from the GitHub site and run them on your own computer. plotly is a Python package developed by the company Plot.ly to interface with their interactive Javascript library either locally or via their web service. Plot.ly also develops an R package to interface with their products as well. It provides an intuitive syntax and ease of use, and is probably the more popular package for interactive graphics from both R and Python. import plotly.express as px fig = px.scatter(mtcars, x = &#39;hp&#39;, y = &#39;mpg&#39;) fig.show() bokeh is an interactive visualization package developed by Anaconda. It is quite powerful, but its code can be rather verbose and granular from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show output_notebook() p = figure() p.xaxis.axis_label = &#39;Horsepower&#39; p.yaxis.axis_label = &#39;Miles per gallon&#39; p.circle(mtcars[&#39;hp&#39;], mtcars[&#39;mpg&#39;], size=10); show(p) altair that leverages ideas from Javascript plotting libraries and a distinctive code syntax that may appeal to some import altair as alt alt.Chart(mtcars).mark_point().encode( x=&#39;hp&#39;, y=&#39;mpg&#39; ).interactive() We won’t focus on these dynamic packages in this workshop in the interests of time, but you can avail of several online resources for these. Package Resources plotly Fundamentals bokeh Tutorial altair Overview 5.3 Univariate plots We will be introducing plotting and code from 3 modules: matplotlib, seaborn and pandas. As we go forth, you may ask the question, which one should I learn? Chris Moffitt has the following advice. A pathway to learning (Chris Moffit) Learn the basic matplotlib terminology, specifically what is a Figure and an Axes . Always use the object-oriented interface. Get in the habit of using it from the start of your analysis. (not really getting into this, but basically don’t use the Matlab form I’ll show at the end, if you don’t have to) Start your visualizations with basic pandas plotting. Use seaborn for the more complex statistical visualizations. Use matplotlib to customize the pandas or seaborn visualization. 5.3.1 pandas 5.3.1.1 Histogram mtcars.plot.hist(y = &#39;mpg&#39;); plt.show() # mtcars.plot(y = &#39;mpg&#39;, kind = &#39;hist&#39;) #mtcars[&#39;mpg&#39;].plot(kind = &#39;hist&#39;) 5.3.1.2 Bar plot mtcars[&#39;cyl&#39;].value_counts().plot.bar(); plt.show() 5.3.1.3 Density plot mtcars[&#39;mpg&#39;].plot( kind = &#39;density&#39;); plt.show() 5.3.2 seaborn 5.3.2.1 Histogram ax = sns.distplot(mtcars[&#39;mpg&#39;], kde=False); plt.show() 5.3.2.2 Bar plot sns.countplot(data = mtcars, x = &#39;cyl&#39;); plt.show() diamonds = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/diamonds.csv.gz&#39;) ordered_colors = [&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;I&#39;,&#39;J&#39;] sns.catplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;color&#39;, kind = &#39;count&#39;, color = &#39;blue&#39;); plt.show() 5.3.2.3 Density plot sns.distplot(mtcars[&#39;mpg&#39;], hist=False); plt.show() 5.4 Bivariate plots 5.4.1 pandas 5.4.1.1 Scatter plot diamonds = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/diamonds.csv.gz&#39;) diamonds.plot(x = &#39;carat&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, kind = &#39;scatter&#39;); plt.show() 5.4.1.2 Box plot diamonds.boxplot(column = &#39;price&#39;, by = &#39;color&#39;); plt.show() 5.4.2 seaborn 5.4.2.1 Scatter plot sns.regplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;carat&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, fit_reg=False); plt.show() sns.scatterplot(data=diamonds, x = &#39;carat&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, linewidth=0); # We set the linewidth to 0, otherwise the lines around the circles # appear white and wash out the figure. Try with any positive # value of linewidth 5.4.2.2 Box plot ordered_color = [&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;I&#39;,&#39;J&#39;] sns.catplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;color&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, order = ordered_color, color = &#39;blue&#39;, kind = &#39;box&#39;); plt.show() 5.4.2.3 Violin plot g = sns.catplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;color&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, kind = &#39;violin&#39;, order = ordered_color); plt.show() 5.4.2.4 Barplot (categorical vs continuous) ordered_colors = [&#39;D&#39;,&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;I&#39;] sns.barplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;color&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, order = ordered_colors); plt.show() sns.barplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;cut&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;); plt.show() 5.4.2.5 Joint plot sns.jointplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;carat&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;); plt.show() sns.jointplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;carat&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, kind = &#39;reg&#39;); plt.show() sns.jointplot(data = diamonds, x = &#39;carat&#39;, y = &#39;price&#39;, kind = &#39;hex&#39;); plt.show() ## Facets and multivariate data The basic idea in this section is to see how we can visualize more than two variables at a time. We will see two strategies: Put multiple graphs on the same frame, with each graph referring to a level of a 3rd variable Create a grid of separate graphs, with each graph referring to a level of a 3rd variable This strategy also can work any time we need to visualize the data corresponding to different levels of a variable, say by gender or race or country. In this example we’re going to start with 4 time series, labelled A, B, C, D. ts = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/ts.csv&#39;) ts.dt = pd.to_datetime(ts.dt) # convert this column to a datetime object ts.head() dt kind value 0 2000-01-01 A 1.442521 1 2000-01-02 A 1.981290 2 2000-01-03 A 1.586494 3 2000-01-04 A 1.378969 4 2000-01-05 A -0.277937 For one strategy we will employ, it is actually a bit easier to change this to a wide data form, using pivot. dfp = ts.pivot(index = &#39;dt&#39;, columns = &#39;kind&#39;, values = &#39;value&#39;) dfp.head() kind A B C D dt 2000-01-01 1.442521 1.808741 0.437415 0.096980 2000-01-02 1.981290 2.277020 0.706127 -1.523108 2000-01-03 1.586494 3.474392 1.358063 -3.100735 2000-01-04 1.378969 2.906132 0.262223 -2.660599 2000-01-05 -0.277937 3.489553 0.796743 -3.417402 fig, ax = plt.subplots() dfp.plot(ax=ax); plt.show() This creates 4 separate time series plots, one for each of the columns labeled A, B, C and D. The x-axis is determined by dfp.index, which during the pivoting operation, we deemed was the values of dt in the original data. Using seaborn… sns.lineplot(data = dfp); plt.show() However, we can achieve this same plot using the original data, and seaborn, in rather short order sns.lineplot(data = ts, x = &#39;dt&#39;, y = &#39;value&#39;, hue = &#39;kind&#39;); plt.show() In this plot, assigning a variable to hue tells seaborn to draw lines (in this case) of different hues based on values of that variable. We can use a bit more granular and explicit code for this as well. This allows us a bit more control of the plot. g = sns.FacetGrid(ts, hue = &#39;kind&#39;, height = 5, aspect = 1.5) g.map(plt.plot, &#39;dt&#39;, &#39;value&#39;).add_legend() &lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid object at 0x12e3a9b80&gt; g.ax.set(xlabel = &#39;Date&#39;, ylabel = &#39;Value&#39;, title = &#39;Time series&#39;); plt.show() ## All of this code chunk needs to be run at one time, otherwise you get weird errors. This ## is true for many plotting commands which are composed of multiple commands. The FacetGrid tells seaborn that we’re going to layer graphs, with layers based on hue and the hues being determined by values of kind. Notice that we can add a few more details like the aspect ratio of the plot and so on. The documentation for FacetGrid, which we will also use for facets below, may be helpful in finding all the options you can control. We can also show more than one kind of layer on a single graph fmri = sns.load_dataset(&#39;fmri&#39;) plt.style.use(&#39;seaborn-notebook&#39;) sns.relplot(x = &#39;timepoint&#39;, y = &#39;signal&#39;, data = fmri); plt.show() sns.relplot(x = &#39;timepoint&#39;, y = &#39;signal&#39;, data = fmri, kind = &#39;line&#39;); plt.show() sns.relplot(x = &#39;timepoint&#39;, y = &#39;signal&#39;, data = fmri, kind = &#39;line&#39;, hue =&#39;event&#39;); plt.show() sns.relplot(x = &#39;timepoint&#39;, y = &#39;signal&#39;, data = fmri, hue = &#39;region&#39;, style = &#39;event&#39;, kind = &#39;line&#39;); plt.show() Here we use color to show the region, and line style (solid vs dashed) to show the event. 5.4.2.6 Scatter plots by group g = sns.FacetGrid(diamonds, hue = &#39;color&#39;, height = 7.5) g.map(plt.scatter, &#39;carat&#39;, &#39;price&#39;).add_legend(); plt.show() Notice that this arranges the colors and values for the color variable in random order. If we have a preferred order we can impose that using the option hue_order. clarity_ranking = [&quot;I1&quot;, &quot;SI2&quot;, &quot;SI1&quot;, &quot;VS2&quot;, &quot;VS1&quot;, &quot;VVS2&quot;, &quot;VVS1&quot;, &quot;IF&quot;] sns.scatterplot(x=&quot;carat&quot;, y=&quot;price&quot;, hue=&quot;clarity&quot;, size=&quot;depth&quot;, hue_order=clarity_ranking, sizes=(1, 8), linewidth=0, data=diamonds); plt.show() 5.4.3 Facets Facets or trellis graphics is a visualization method where we draw multiple plots in a grid, with each plot corresponding to unique values of a particular variable or combinations of variables. This has also been called small multiples. We’ll proceed with an example using the iris dataset. iris = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/iris.csv&#39;) iris.head() sepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width species 0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 1 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 3 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 4 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa g = sns.FacetGrid(iris, col = &#39;species&#39;, hue = &#39;species&#39;, height = 5) g.map(plt.scatter, &#39;sepal_width&#39;, &#39;sepal_length&#39;).add_legend(); plt.show() Here we use FacetGrid to indicate that we’re creating multiple subplots by specifying the option col (for column). So this code says we are going to create one plot per level of species, arranged as separate columns (or in effect along one row). You could also specify row which would arrange the plots one to a row, or, in effect, in one column. The map function says, take the facets I’ve defined and stored in g, and in each one, plot a scatter plot with sepal_width on the x-axis and sepal_length on the y-axis. We could also use relplot for a more compact solution. sns.relplot(x = &#39;sepal_width&#39;, y = &#39;sepal_length&#39;, data = iris, col = &#39;species&#39;, hue = &#39;species&#39;); plt.show() A bit more of a complicated example, using the fmri data, where we’re coloring lines based on the subject, and creating a 2-d grid, where region of the brain in along columns and event type is along rows. sns.relplot(x=&quot;timepoint&quot;, y=&quot;signal&quot;, hue=&quot;subject&quot;, col=&quot;region&quot;, row=&quot;event&quot;, height=3, kind=&quot;line&quot;, estimator=None, data=fmri); plt.show() In the following example, we want to show how each subject fares for each of the two events, just within the frontal region. We let seaborn figure out the layout, only specifying that we’ll be going along rows (“by column”) and also saying we’ll wrap around to the beginning once we’ve got to 5 columns. Note we use the query function to filter the dataset. sns.relplot(x=&quot;timepoint&quot;, y=&quot;signal&quot;, hue=&quot;event&quot;, style=&quot;event&quot;, col=&quot;subject&quot;, col_wrap=5, height=3, aspect=.75, linewidth=2.5, kind=&quot;line&quot;, data=fmri.query(&quot;region == &#39;frontal&#39;&quot;)); plt.show() In the following example we want to compare the distribution of price from the diamonds dataset by color, and so it makes sense to create density plots of the price distribution and stack them one below the next so we can visually compare them. ordered_colors = [&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;G&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;I&#39;,&#39;J&#39;] g = sns.FacetGrid(data = diamonds, row = &#39;color&#39;, height = 1.7, aspect = 4, row_order = ordered_colors) g.map(sns.kdeplot, &#39;price&#39;); plt.show() You need to use FacetGrid to create sets of univariate plots since there is no particular method that allows univariate plots over a grid like relplot for bivariate plots. 5.4.4 Pairs plots The pairs plot is a quick way to compare every pair of variables in a dataset (or at least, every pair of continuous variables) in a grid. You can specify what kind of univariate plot will be displayed on the diagonal locations on the grid, and which bivariate plots will be displayed on the off-diagonal locations. sns.pairplot(data=iris); plt.show() You can achieve more customization using PairGrid. g = sns.PairGrid(iris, diag_sharey=False); g.map_upper(sns.scatterplot); g.map_lower(sns.kdeplot, colors=&quot;C0&quot;); g.map_diag(sns.kdeplot, lw=2); plt.show() 5.5 Customizing the look 5.5.1 Themes There are several themes available in the modern matplotlib, some of which borrow from seaborn. You can see the available themes and play around. plt.style.available [&#39;seaborn-dark&#39;, &#39;seaborn-darkgrid&#39;, &#39;seaborn-ticks&#39;, &#39;fivethirtyeight&#39;, &#39;seaborn-whitegrid&#39;, &#39;classic&#39;, &#39;_classic_test&#39;, &#39;fast&#39;, &#39;seaborn-talk&#39;, &#39;seaborn-dark-palette&#39;, &#39;seaborn-bright&#39;, &#39;seaborn-pastel&#39;, &#39;grayscale&#39;, &#39;seaborn-notebook&#39;, &#39;ggplot&#39;, &#39;seaborn-colorblind&#39;, &#39;seaborn-muted&#39;, &#39;seaborn&#39;, &#39;Solarize_Light2&#39;, &#39;seaborn-paper&#39;, &#39;bmh&#39;, &#39;tableau-colorblind10&#39;, &#39;seaborn-white&#39;, &#39;dark_background&#39;, &#39;seaborn-poster&#39;, &#39;seaborn-deep&#39;] See some examples below. plt.style.use(&#39;fivethirtyeight&#39;) sns.scatterplot(data = iris, x = &#39;sepal_width&#39;, y = &#39;sepal_length&#39;); plt.show() plt.style.use(&#39;bmh&#39;) sns.scatterplot(data = iris, x = &#39;sepal_width&#39;, y = &#39;sepal_length&#39;); plt.show() plt.style.use(&#39;classic&#39;) sns.scatterplot(data = iris, x = &#39;sepal_width&#39;, y = &#39;sepal_length&#39;); plt.show() plt.style.use(&#39;ggplot&#39;) sns.scatterplot(data = iris, x = &#39;sepal_width&#39;, y = &#39;sepal_length&#39;); plt.show() plt.style.use(&#39;Solarize_Light2&#39;) sns.scatterplot(data = iris, x = &#39;sepal_width&#39;, y = &#39;sepal_length&#39;); plt.show() One small syntax point. You may have noticed in your own work that you get a little annoying line in the output when you plot. You can prevent that from happening by putting a semi-colon (;) after the last plotting command 5.6 Finer control with matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-usage-py As you can see from the figure, you can control each aspect of the plot displayed above using matplotlib. I won’t go into the details, and will leave it to you to look at the matplotlib documentation and examples if you need to customize at this level of granularity. The following is an example using pure matplotlib. You can see how you can build up a plot. The crucial part here is that you need to run the code from each chunk together. from matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter data = {&#39;Barton LLC&#39;: 109438.50, &#39;Frami, Hills and Schmidt&#39;: 103569.59, &#39;Fritsch, Russel and Anderson&#39;: 112214.71, &#39;Jerde-Hilpert&#39;: 112591.43, &#39;Keeling LLC&#39;: 100934.30, &#39;Koepp Ltd&#39;: 103660.54, &#39;Kulas Inc&#39;: 137351.96, &#39;Trantow-Barrows&#39;: 123381.38, &#39;White-Trantow&#39;: 135841.99, &#39;Will LLC&#39;: 104437.60} group_data = list(data.values()) group_names = list(data.keys()) group_mean = np.mean(group_data) plt.style.use(&#39;default&#39;) fig, ax = plt.subplots() plt.show() fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.barh(group_names, group_data); plt.show() fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.barh(group_names, group_data) &lt;BarContainer object of 10 artists&gt; ax.set(xlim = [-10000, 140000], xlabel = &#39;Total Revenue&#39;, ylabel = &#39;Company&#39;, title = &#39;Company Revenue&#39;); plt.show() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4)) ax.barh(group_names, group_data) &lt;BarContainer object of 10 artists&gt; labels = ax.get_xticklabels() plt.setp(labels, rotation=45, horizontalalignment=&#39;right&#39;) [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None] ax.set(xlim=[-10000, 140000], xlabel=&#39;Total Revenue&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Company&#39;, title=&#39;Company Revenue&#39;); plt.show() After you have created your figure, you do need to save it to disk so that you can use it in your Word or Markdown or PowerPoint document. You can see the formats available. fig.canvas.get_supported_filetypes() {&#39;ps&#39;: &#39;Postscript&#39;, &#39;eps&#39;: &#39;Encapsulated Postscript&#39;, &#39;pdf&#39;: &#39;Portable Document Format&#39;, &#39;pgf&#39;: &#39;PGF code for LaTeX&#39;, &#39;png&#39;: &#39;Portable Network Graphics&#39;, &#39;raw&#39;: &#39;Raw RGBA bitmap&#39;, &#39;rgba&#39;: &#39;Raw RGBA bitmap&#39;, &#39;svg&#39;: &#39;Scalable Vector Graphics&#39;, &#39;svgz&#39;: &#39;Scalable Vector Graphics&#39;, &#39;jpg&#39;: &#39;Joint Photographic Experts Group&#39;, &#39;jpeg&#39;: &#39;Joint Photographic Experts Group&#39;, &#39;tif&#39;: &#39;Tagged Image File Format&#39;, &#39;tiff&#39;: &#39;Tagged Image File Format&#39;} The type will be determined by the ending of the file name. You can add some options depending on the type. I’m showing an example of saving the figure to a PNG file. Typically I’ll save figures to a vector graphics format like PDF, and then convert into other formats, since that results in minimal resolution loss. You of course have the option to save to your favorite format. # fig.savefig(&#39;sales.png&#39;, dpi = 300, bbox_inches = &#39;tight&#39;) 5.6.1 Matlab-like plotting matplotlib was originally developed to emulate Matlab. Though this kind of syntax is no longer recommended, it is still available and may be of use to those coming to Python from Matlab or Octave. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4]); plt.ylabel(&#39;some numbers&#39;); plt.show() import numpy as np # evenly sampled time at 200ms intervals t = np.arange(0., 5., 0.2) # red dashes, blue squares and green triangles plt.plot(t, t, &#39;r--&#39;, t, t**2, &#39;bs&#39;, t, t**3, &#39;g^&#39;); plt.show() def f(t): return np.exp(-t) * np.cos(2*np.pi*t) t1 = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.1) t2 = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.02) plt.figure(); plt.subplot(211); plt.plot(t1, f(t1), &#39;bo&#39;, t2, f(t2), &#39;k&#39;); plt.subplot(212); plt.plot(t2, np.cos(2*np.pi*t2), &#39;r--&#39;); plt.show() 5.7 Resources A really nice online resource for learning data visualization in Python is the Python Graph Gallery.

["statistical-analysis.html", "Chapter 6 Statistical analysis 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Descriptive statistics 6.3 Simulation and inference 6.4 Classical hypothesis testing 6.5 Regression analysis", " Chapter 6 Statistical analysis 6.1 Introduction Statistical analysis usually encompasses 3 activities in a data science workflow. These are (a) descriptive analysis, (b) hypothesis testing and (c) statistical modeling. Descriptive analysis refers to a description of the data, which includes computing summary statistics and drawing plots. Hypothesis testing usually refers to statistically seeing if two (or more) groups are different from each other based on some metrics. Modeling refers to fitting a curve to the data to describe the relationship patterns of different variables in a data set. In terms of Python packages that can address these three tasks: Task Packages Descriptive statistics pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn Hypothesis testing scipy, statsmodels Modeling statsmodels, lifelines, scikit-learn 6.2 Descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics that are often computed are the mean, median, standard deviation, inter-quartile range, pairwise correlations, and the like. Most of these functions are available in numpy, and hence are available in pandas. We have already seen how we can compute these statistics and have even computed grouped statistics. For example, we will compute these using the diamonds dataset import numpy as np import scipy as sc import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns diamonds = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/diamonds.csv.gz&#39;) diamonds.groupby(&#39;color&#39;)[&#39;price&#39;].agg([np.mean, np.median, np.std]) mean median std color D 3169.954096 1838.0 3356.590935 E 3076.752475 1739.0 3344.158685 F 3724.886397 2343.5 3784.992007 G 3999.135671 2242.0 4051.102846 H 4486.669196 3460.0 4215.944171 I 5091.874954 3730.0 4722.387604 J 5323.818020 4234.0 4438.187251 There were other examples we saw yesterday along these lines. Refer to both the python_tools_ds and python_pandas documents 6.3 Simulation and inference Hypothesis testing is one of the areas where statistics is often used. There are functions for a lot of the standard statistical tests in scipy and statsmodels. However, I’m going to take a little detour to see if we can get some understanding of hypothesis tests using the powerful simulation capabilities of Python. We’ll visit the in-built functions available in scipy and statsmodels as well. 6.3.1 Simulation and hypothesis testing Question: You have a coin and you flip it 100 times. You get 54 heads. How likely is it that you have a fair coin? We can simulate this process, which is random, using Python. The process of heads and tails from coin tosses can be modeled as a binomial distribution. We can repeat this experiment many many times on our computer, making the assumption that we have a fair coin, and then seeing how likely what we observed is under that assumption. Simulation under reasonable assumptions is a great way to understand our data and the underlying data generating processes. In the modern era, it has most famously been used by Nate Silver of ESPN to simulate national elections in the US. There are many examples in engineering where simulations are done to understand a technology and figure out its tolerances and weaknesses, like in aircraft testing. It is also commonly used in epidemic modeling to help understand how an epidemic would spread under different conditions. rng = np.random.RandomState(205) # Seed the random number generator x = rng.binomial(100, 0.5, 100000) # Simulate 100,000 experiments of tossing a fair coin 100 times sns.distplot(x, kde=True, rug=False) plt.axvline(54, color = &#39;r&#39;); # What we observed plt.xlabel(&#39;Number of heads&#39;); pd.Series(x).describe() # We convert to pd.Series to take advantage of the `describe` function. count 100000.000000 mean 49.995590 std 5.011938 min 27.000000 25% 47.000000 50% 50.000000 75% 53.000000 max 72.000000 dtype: float64 What we see from the histogram and the description of the data above is the patterns in data we would expect if we repeated this random experiment. We can already make some observations. First, we do see that the average number of heads we expect to get is 50, which validates that our experiment is using a fair coin. Second, we can reasonably get as few as 27 heads and as many as 72 heads even with a fair coin. In fact, we could look at what values we would expect to see 95% of the time. np.quantile(x, [0.025, 0.975]) array([40., 60.]) This says that 95% of the time we’ll see values between 40 and 60. (This is not a confidence interval. This is the actual results of a simulation study. A confidence interval would be computed based on a single experiment, assuming a binomial distribution. We’ll come to that later). So how likely would we be to see the 54 heads in 100 tosses assuming a fair coin? This can be computed as the proportion of experiments np.mean(x &gt; 54) # convince yourself of this 0.18456 This is what would be considered the p-value for the test that the coin is fair. The p-value of a statistical hypothesis test is the likelihood that we would see an outcome at least as extreme as we observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis (H0) that we chose is actually true. In our case, that null hypothesis is that the coin we’re tossing is fair. The p-value only gives evidence against the null hypothesis, but does not give evidence for the null hypothesis. In other words, if the p-value is small (smaller than some threshold we deem reasonable), then we can claim evidence against the null hypothesis, but if the p-value is large, we cannot say the null hypothesis is true. What happens if we increase the number of tosses, and we look at the proportion of heads. We observe 54% heads. rng = np.random.RandomState(205) x = rng.binomial(10000, 0.5, 100000)/10000 sns.distplot(x) plt.axvline(0.54, color = &#39;r&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Proportion of heads&#39;); pd.Series(x).describe() count 100000.000000 mean 0.499991 std 0.004994 min 0.478100 25% 0.496600 50% 0.500000 75% 0.503400 max 0.520300 dtype: float64 Well, that changed the game significantly. If we up the number of coin tosses per experiment to 10,000, so 100-fold increase, then we do not see very much variation in the proportion of tosses that are heads. This is expected behavior because of a statistical theorem called the Law of Large Numbers, which essentially says that if you do larger and larger sized random experiments with the same experimental setup, your estimate of the true population parameter (in this case the true chance of getting a head, or 0.5 for a fair coin) will become more and more precise. Now we see that for a fair coin, we should reasonably see between 47.8% and 52% of tosses should be heads. This is quite an improvement from the 27%-72% range we saw with 100 tosses. We can compute our p-value in the same way as before. np.mean(x &gt; 0.54) 0.0 So we would never see 54% of our tosses be heads if we tossed a fair coin 10,000 times. Now, with a larger experiment, we would reject our null hypothesis H0 that we have a fair coin. So same observation, but more data, changes our inference from not having sufficient evidence to say that the coin isn’t fair to saying that it isn’t fair quite definitively. This is directly due to the increased precision of our estimates and thus our ability to differentiate between much smaller differences in the truth. Let’s see a bit more about what’s going on here. Suppose we assume that the coin’s true likelihood of getting a head is really 0.55, so a very small bias towards heads. Food for thought: Is the difference between 0.50 and 0.54 worth worrying about? It probably depends. We’re going to compare what we would reasonably see over many repeated experiments given the coin has a 0.50 (fair) and a 0.55 (slightly biased) chance of a head. First, we’ll do experiments of 100 tosses of a coin. rng = np.random.RandomState(205) x11 = rng.binomial(100, 0.5, 100000)/100 # Getting proportion of heads x12 = rng.binomial(100, 0.55, 100000)/100 sns.distplot(x11, label = &#39;Fair&#39;) sns.distplot(x12, label = &#39;Biased&#39;) &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x11fa4a640&gt; plt.xlabel(&#39;Proportion of heads&#39;) plt.legend(); We see that there is a great deal of overlap in the potential outcomes over 100,000 repetitions of these experiments, so we have a lot of uncertainty about which model (fair or biased) is the truth. Now, if we up our experiment to 10,000 tosses of each coin, and again repeat the experiment 100,000 times, rng = np.random.RandomState(205) x21 = rng.binomial(10000, 0.5, 100000)/10000 x22 = rng.binomial(10000, 0.55, 100000)/10000 sns.distplot(x21, label = &#39;Fair&#39;) sns.distplot(x22, label = &#39;Biased&#39;) &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x12e85adc0&gt; plt.xlabel(&#39;Proportion of heads&#39;) plt.legend(); We now find almost no overlap between the potential outcomes, so we can very easily distinguish the two models. This is part of what gathering more data (number of tosses) buys you. We typically measure this ability to distinguish between two models using concepts of statistical power, which is the likelihood that we would find an observation at least as extreme as what we observed, under the alternative model (in this case, the biased coin model). We can calculate the statistical power quite easily for the two sets of simulated experiments. Remember, we observed 54% heads in our one instance of each experiment that we actually observed. By doing simulations, we’re “playing God” and seeing what could have happened, but in practice we only do the experiment once (how many clinical trials of an expensive drug would you really want to do?). pval1 = np.mean(x11 &gt; 0.54) pval2 = np.mean(x21 &gt; 0.54) power1 = np.mean(x12 &gt; 0.54) power2 = np.mean(x22 &gt; 0.54) print(&#39;The p-value when n=100 is &#39;, np.round(pval1, 2)) The p-value when n=100 is 0.18 print(&#39;The p-value when n=10,000 is &#39;, np.round(pval2, 2)) The p-value when n=10,000 is 0.0 print(&#39;Statistical power when n=100 is &#39;, np.round(power1, 2)) Statistical power when n=100 is 0.54 print(&#39;Statistical power when n=10,000 is &#39;, np.round(power2, 2)) Statistical power when n=10,000 is 0.98 So as n goes up, the p-value for the same experimental outcome goes down and the statistical power goes up. This is a general rule with increasing sample size. This idea can be used to design a two-armed experiment. Suppose we are looking at the difference in proportion of mice who gained weight between a wild-type mouse and a knockout variant. Since mice are expensive, let’s limit the number of mice we’ll use in each arm to 10. We expect 30% of the wild-type mice to gain weight, and expect a higher proportion of the knockouts will gain weight. This is again the setup for a binomial experiment, with the number of “coin tosses” being 10 for each of the arms. We’re going to do two sets of experiments, one for the WT and one for the KO, and see the difference in proportions of weight gain (‘heads’) between them, and repeat it 100,000 times. rng = np.random.RandomState(304) N = 10 weight_gain_wt0 = rng.binomial(N, 0.3, 100000)/N # Get proportion weight_gain_ko0 = rng.binomial(N, 0.3, 100000)/N # Assume first (null hypothesis) that there is no difference diff_weight_gain0 = weight_gain_ko0 - weight_gain_wt0 sns.distplot(diff_weight_gain0, kde=False); # Since we only have 10 mice each, this histogram is not very smooth. # No matter! We usually design the actual test by choosing a cutoff in the difference in proportions and stating that we will reject the null hypothesis if our observed difference exceeds this cutoff. We choose the cutoff so that the p-value of the cutoff is some pre-determined error rate, typically 0.05 or 5% (This is not golden or set in stone. We’ll discuss this later). Let’s find that cutoff from this simulation. This will correspond to the 95th percentile of this simulated distribution. np.round(np.quantile(diff_weight_gain0, 0.95), 2) 0.3 This means that at least 5% of the values will be 0.3 or bigger. In fact, this proportion is np.mean(diff_weight_gain0 &gt; 0.3) 0.06673 So we’ll take 0.3 as the cutoff for our test (It’s fine if the Type 1 error is more than 0.05. If we take the next largest value in the simulation, we dip below 0.05). We’re basically done specifying the testing rule. What we (and reviewers) like to know at this point is, what is the difference level for which you might get 80% power. The thinking is that if the true difference was, say, p &gt; 0 rather than 0 (under the null hypothesis), we would reject the null hypothesis, i.e., get our observed difference to be more than 0.3, at least 80% of the time. We want to find out how big that value of p is. In other words, what is the level of difference in proportions at which we can be reasonably certain that our test will REJECT H0, given our sample size, when the true difference in proportions is p. Another way of saying this is how big does the difference in true proportions have to be before we would be fairly confident statistically of distinguishing that we have a difference between the two groups given our chosen sample size, i.e., fairly small overlaps in the two competing distributions. We can also do this using simulation, by keeping the WT group at 0.3, increasing the KO group gradually, simulating the distribution of the difference in proportion and seeing at what point we get to a statistical power of about 80%. Recall, we’ve already determined that our test will reject H0 when the observed difference is greater than 0.3 p1 = np.linspace(0.3, 0.9, 100) power = np.zeros(len(p1)) for i, p in enumerate(p1): weight_gain_wt1 = rng.binomial(N, 0.3, 100000)/N weight_gain_ko1 = rng.binomial(N, p, 100000)/N diff_weight_gain1 = weight_gain_ko1 - weight_gain_wt1 power[i] = np.mean(diff_weight_gain1 &gt; 0.3) sns.lineplot(p1, power) plt.axhline(0.8, color = &#39;black&#39;, linestyle = &#39;--&#39;); plt.ylabel(&#39;Statistical power&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Proportion in KO mice&#39;); np.round(p1[np.argmin(np.abs(power - 0.8))] - 0.3, 2) # Find the location in the p1 array where power is closest to 0.8 0.48 So to get to 80% power, we would need the true difference in proportion to be 0.48, or that at least 78% of KO mice should gain weight on average. This is quite a big difference, and its probably not very interesting scientifically to look for such a big difference, since it’s quite unlikely. If we could afford 100 mice per arm, what would this look like? rng = np.random.RandomState(304) N = 100 weight_gain_wt0 = rng.binomial(N, 0.3, 100000)/N # Get proportion weight_gain_ko0 = rng.binomial(N, 0.3, 100000)/N # Assume first (null hypothesis) that there is no difference diff_weight_gain0 = weight_gain_ko0 - weight_gain_wt0 cutoff = np.quantile(diff_weight_gain0, 0.95) p1 = np.linspace(0.3, 0.9, 100) power = np.zeros(len(p1)) for i, p in enumerate(p1): weight_gain_wt1 = rng.binomial(N, 0.3, 100000)/N weight_gain_ko1 = rng.binomial(N, p, 100000)/N diff_weight_gain1 = weight_gain_ko1 - weight_gain_wt1 power[i] = np.mean(diff_weight_gain1 &gt; cutoff) sns.lineplot(p1, power) plt.axhline(0.8, color = &#39;black&#39;, linestyle = &#39;--&#39;); plt.ylabel(&#39;Statistical power&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Proportion in KO mice&#39;); np.round(p1[np.argmin(np.abs(power - 0.8))] - 0.3, 2) 0.17 The minimum detectable difference for 80% power is now down to 0.17, so we’d need the KO mice in truth to show weight gain 47% of the time, compared to 30% in WT mice. This is more reasonable scientifically as a query. 6.3.2 A permutation test A permutation test is a 2-group test that asks whether two groups are different with respect to some metric. Let us look at a breast cancer proteomics experiment to illustrate this. The experimental data contains protein expression for over 12 thousand proteins, along with clinical data. We can ask, for example, whether a particular protein expression differs by ER status. brca = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/brca.csv&#39;) brca.head() Unnamed: 0 Complete TCGA ID Gender ... NP_004065 NP_068752 NP_219494 0 0 TCGA-A2-A0CM FEMALE ... NaN NaN NaN 1 1 TCGA-BH-A18Q FEMALE ... -1.778435 NaN -3.069752 2 2 TCGA-A7-A0CE FEMALE ... NaN NaN NaN 3 3 TCGA-D8-A142 FEMALE ... NaN NaN NaN 4 4 TCGA-AO-A0J6 FEMALE ... NaN NaN -3.753616 [5 rows x 12585 columns] We will first do the classical t-test, that is available in the scipy package. import scipy as sc import statsmodels as sm test_probe = &#39;NP_001193600&#39; tst = sc.stats.ttest_ind(brca[brca[&#39;ER Status&#39;]==&#39;Positive&#39;][test_probe], # Need [] since names have spaces brca[brca[&#39;ER Status&#39;]==&#39;Negative&#39;][test_probe], nan_policy = &#39;omit&#39;) np.round(tst.pvalue, 3) 0.277 The idea about a permutation test is that, if there is truly no difference then it shouldn’t make a difference if we shuffled the labels of ER status over the study individuals. That’s literally what we will do. We will do this several times, and look at the average difference in expression each time. This will form the null distribution under our assumption of no differences by ER status. We’ll then see where our observed data falls, and then be able to compute a p-value. The difference between the simulations we just did and a permutation test is that the permutation test is based only on the observed data. No particular models are assumed and no new data is simulated. All we’re doing is shuffling the labels among the subjects, but keeping their actual data intact. nsim = 10000 rng = np.random.RandomState(294) x = np.where(brca[&#39;ER Status&#39;]==&#39;Positive&#39;, -1, 1) y = brca[test_probe].to_numpy() obs_diff = np.nanmean(y[x==1]) - np.nanmean(y[x==-1]) diffs = np.zeros(nsim) for i in range(nsim): x1 = rng.permutation(x) diffs[i] = np.nanmean(y[x1==1]) - np.nanmean(y[x1 == -1]) sns.distplot(diffs) plt.axvline(x = obs_diff, color =&#39;r&#39;); pval = np.mean(np.abs(diffs) &gt; np.abs(obs_diff)) f&quot;P-value from permutation test is {pval}&quot; &#39;P-value from permutation test is 0.2606&#39; This is pretty close to what we got from the t-test 6.3.3 Testing many proteins We could do the permutation test all the proteins using the array operations in numpy expr_names = [u for u in list(brca.columns) if u.find(&#39;NP&#39;) &gt; -1] # Find all column names with NP exprs = brca[expr_names] # Extract the protein data x = np.where(brca[&#39;ER Status&#39;]==&#39;Positive&#39;, -1, 1) obs_diffs = exprs[x==1].mean(axis=0)-exprs[x==-1].mean(axis=0) nsim = 1000 diffs = np.zeros((nsim, exprs.shape[1])) for i in range(nsim): x1 = rng.permutation(x) diffs[i,:] =exprs[x1==1].mean(axis=0) - exprs[x1==-1].mean(axis=0) pvals = np.zeros(exprs.shape[1]) len(pvals) 12395 for i in range(len(pvals)): pvals[i] = np.mean(diffs[:,i] &gt; obs_diffs.iloc[i]) sns.distplot(pvals); This plot shows that there is probably some proteins which are differentially expressed between ER+ and ER- patients. (If no proteins had any difference, this histogram would be flat, since the p-values would be uniformly distributed). The ideas around Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) can also be applied here. exprs_shortlist = [u for i, u in enumerate(list(exprs.columns)) if pvals[i] &lt; 0.0001 ] len(exprs_shortlist) 511 This means that, if we considered a p-value cutoff for screening at 0.0001, we would select 486 of the 12395 proteins for further study. 6.3.4 Getting a confidence interval using the bootstrap We can use simulations to obtain a model-free confidence interval for particular parameters of interest based on our observed data. The technique we will demonstrate is called the bootstrap. The idea is that if we sample with replacement from our observed data to get another data set of the same size as the observed data, and compute our statistic of interest, and then repeat this process many times, then the distribution of our statistic that we will obtain this way will be very similar to the true sampling distribution of the statistic if we could “play God”. This has strong theoretical foundations from work done by several researchers in the 80s and 90s. Choose the number of simulations nsim for each iteration (1,…,nsim) Simulate a dataset with replacement from the original data. compute and store the statistic Compute the 2.5th and 97.5th percential of the distribution of the statistic. This is your confidence interval. Let’s see this in action. Suppose we tossed a coin 100 times. We’re going to find a confidence interval for the proportion of heads from this coin. rng = np.random.RandomState(304) x = rng.binomial(1, 0.7, 100) x array([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]) This gives the sequence of heads (1) and tails (0), assuming the true probability of heads is 0.7. We now create 100000 bootstrap samples from here. nsim = 100000 boots = np.random.choice(x, (len(x), nsim), replace = True) # sample from the data boot_estimates = boots.mean(axis = 0) # compute mean of each sample, i.e proportion of heads sns.distplot(boot_estimates); np.quantile(boot_estimates, (0.025, 0.975)) # Find 2.5 and 97.5-th percentiles array([0.66, 0.83]) So our 95% bootstrap confidence interval is (0.66, 0.83). Our true value of 0.7 certainly falls in it. 6.4 Classical hypothesis testing Python has the tools to do classic hypothesis testing as well. Several functions are available in the scipy.stats module. The commonly used tests that are available are as follows: Function Test ttest_1samp One-sample t-test ttest_ind Two-sample t-test ttest_rel Paired t-test wilcoxon Wilcoxon signed-rank test (nonparametric paired t-test) ranksum Wilcoxon rank-sum test (nonparametric 2-sample t-test) chi2_contingency Chi-square test for independence fisher_exact Fisher’s exact test on a 2x2 contingency table f_oneway One-way ANOVA pearsonr Testing for correlation There are also several tests in statsmodels.stats Functions Tests proportions_ztest Test for difference in proportions mcnemar McNemar’s test sign_test Sign test multipletests p-value correction for multiple tests fdrcorrection p-value correction by FDR We’ve seen an example of these tests earlier. . 6.5 Regression analysis The regression modeling frameworks in Python are mainly in statsmodels, though some of it can be found in scikit-learn which we will see tomorrow. We will use the diamonds dataset for demonstration purposes. We will attempt to model the diamond price against several of the other diamond characteristics. import statsmodels.api as sm import statsmodels.formula.api as smf # Use the formula interface to statsmodels mod1 = smf.glm(&#39;price ~ carat + clarity + depth + cut + color&#39;, data = diamonds).fit() mod1.summary() &lt;class &#39;statsmodels.iolib.summary.Summary&#39;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot; Generalized Linear Model Regression Results ============================================================================== Dep.

This will read as “price depends on carat, clarity, depth, cut and color”. Underneath a lot is going on. color, clarity, and cut are all categorical variables. They actually need to be expanded into dummy variables, so we will have one column for each category level, which is 1 when the diamond is of that category and 0 otherwise.

["machine-learning-using-python.html", "Chapter 7 Machine Learning using Python 7.1 Scikit-learn 7.2 The methods 7.3 A data analytic example", " Chapter 7 Machine Learning using Python 7.1 Scikit-learn Scikit-learn (sklearn) is the main Python package for machine learning. It is a widely-used and well-regarded package. However, there are a couple of challenges to using it given the usual pandas-based data munging pipeline. sklearn requires that all inputs be numeric, and in fact, numpy arrays. sklearn requires that all categorical variables by replaced by 0/1 dummy variables sklearn requires us to separate the predictors from the outcome. We need to have one X matrix for the predictors and one y vector for the outcome. The big issue, of course, is the first point. Given we used pandas precisely because we wanted to be able to keep heterogenous data. We have to be able to convert non-numeric data to numeric. pandas does help us out with this problem. First of all, we know that all pandas Series and DataFrame objects can be converted to numpy arrays using the value or to_numpy functions. Second, we can easily extract a single variable from the data set using either the usual extracton methods or the pop function. Third, pandas gives us a way to convert all categorical values to numeric dummy variables using the get_dummies function. This is actually a more desirable solution than what you will see in cyberspace, which is to use the OneHotEncoder function from sklearn. If the outcome variable is not numeric, we can LabelEncoder function from the sklearn.preprocessing submodule. I just threw a bunch of jargon at you. Let’s see what this means. 7.1.1 Transforming the outcome/target import numpy as np import pandas as pd import sklearn import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns iris = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/iris.csv&#39;) iris.head() sepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width species 0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 1 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 3 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 4 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa Let’s hit the first issue first. We need to separate out the outcome (the variable we want to predict) from the predictors (in this case the sepal and petal measurements). y = iris[&#39;species&#39;] X = iris.drop(&#39;species&#39;, axis = 1) # drops column, makes a copy Another way to do this is y = iris.pop(&#39;species&#39;) If you look at this, iris now only has 4 columns. So we could just use iris after the pop application, as the predictor set We still have to update y to become numeric. This is where the sklearn functions start to be handy from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder le = LabelEncoder() y = le.fit_transform(y) y array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) Let’s talk about this code, since it’s very typical of the way the sklearn code works. First, we import a method (LabelEncoder) from the appropriate sklearn module. The second line, le = LabelEncoder() works to “turn on” the method. This is like taking a power tool off the shelf and plugging it in to a socket. It’s now ready to work. The third line does the actual work. The fit_transform function transforms the data you input into it based on the method it is then attached to. Let’s make a quick analogy. You can plug in both a power washer and a jackhammer to get them ready to go. You can then apply each of them to your driveway. They “transform” the driveway in different ways depending on which tool is used. The washer would “transform” the driveway by cleaning it, while the jackhammer would transform the driveway by breaking it. There’s an interesting invisible quirk to the code, though. The object le also got transformed during this process. There were pieces added to it during the fit_transform process. le = LabelEncoder() d1 = dir(le) y = le.fit_transform( pd.read_csv(&#39;data/iris.csv&#39;)[&#39;species&#39;]) d2 = dir(le) set(d2).difference(set(d1)) # set of things in d2 but not in d1 {&#39;classes_&#39;} So we see that there is a new component added, called classes_. le.classes_ array([&#39;setosa&#39;, &#39;versicolor&#39;, &#39;virginica&#39;], dtype=object) So the original labels aren’t destroyed; they are being stored. This can be useful. le.inverse_transform([0,1,1,2,0]) array([&#39;setosa&#39;, &#39;versicolor&#39;, &#39;versicolor&#39;, &#39;virginica&#39;, &#39;setosa&#39;], dtype=object) So we can transform back from the numeric to the labels. Keep this in hand, since it will prove useful after we have done some predictions using a ML model, which will give numeric predictions. 7.1.2 Transforming the predictors Let’s look at a second example. The diamonds dataset has several categorical variables that would need to be transformed. diamonds = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/diamonds.csv.gz&#39;) y = diamonds.pop(&#39;price&#39;).values X = pd.get_dummies(diamonds) type(X) &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; X.info() &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 53940 entries, 0 to 53939 Data columns (total 26 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 carat 53940 non-null float64 1 depth 53940 non-null float64 2 table 53940 non-null float64 3 x 53940 non-null float64 4 y 53940 non-null float64 5 z 53940 non-null float64 6 cut_Fair 53940 non-null uint8 7 cut_Good 53940 non-null uint8 8 cut_Ideal 53940 non-null uint8 9 cut_Premium 53940 non-null uint8 10 cut_Very Good 53940 non-null uint8 11 color_D 53940 non-null uint8 12 color_E 53940 non-null uint8 13 color_F 53940 non-null uint8 14 color_G 53940 non-null uint8 15 color_H 53940 non-null uint8 16 color_I 53940 non-null uint8 17 color_J 53940 non-null uint8 18 clarity_I1 53940 non-null uint8 19 clarity_IF 53940 non-null uint8 20 clarity_SI1 53940 non-null uint8 21 clarity_SI2 53940 non-null uint8 22 clarity_VS1 53940 non-null uint8 23 clarity_VS2 53940 non-null uint8 24 clarity_VVS1 53940 non-null uint8 25 clarity_VVS2 53940 non-null uint8 dtypes: float64(6), uint8(20) memory usage: 3.5 MB So everything is now numeric!!. Let’s take a peek inside. X.columns Index([&#39;carat&#39;, &#39;depth&#39;, &#39;table&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39;, &#39;cut_Fair&#39;, &#39;cut_Good&#39;, &#39;cut_Ideal&#39;, &#39;cut_Premium&#39;, &#39;cut_Very Good&#39;, &#39;color_D&#39;, &#39;color_E&#39;, &#39;color_F&#39;, &#39;color_G&#39;, &#39;color_H&#39;, &#39;color_I&#39;, &#39;color_J&#39;, &#39;clarity_I1&#39;, &#39;clarity_IF&#39;, &#39;clarity_SI1&#39;, &#39;clarity_SI2&#39;, &#39;clarity_VS1&#39;, &#39;clarity_VS2&#39;, &#39;clarity_VVS1&#39;, &#39;clarity_VVS2&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) So, it looks like the continuous variables remain intact, but the categorical variables got exploded out. Each variable name has a level with it, which represents the particular level it is representing. Each of these variables, called dummy variables, are numerical 0/1 variables. For example, color_F is 1 for those diamonds which have color F, and 0 otherwise. pd.crosstab(X[&#39;color_F&#39;], diamonds[&#39;color&#39;]) color D E F G H I J color_F 0 6775 9797 0 11292 8304 5422 2808 1 0 0 9542 0 0 0 0 7.2 The methods We mentioned a bunch of methods in the slides. Let’s look at where they are in sklearn ML method Code to call it Decision Tree sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier, sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor Random Forest sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier, sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor Linear Regression sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression Logistic Regression sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression Support Vector Machines sklearn.svm.LinearSVC, sklearn.svm.LinearSVR The general method that the code will follow is : from sklearn.... import Machine machine = Machine(*parameters*) machine.fit(X, y) 7.2.1 A quick example from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor lm = LinearRegression() dt = DecisionTreeRegressor() Lets manufacture some data x = np.linspace(0, 10, 200) y = 2 + 3*x - 5*(x**2) d = pd.DataFrame({&#39;x&#39;: x}) lm.fit(d,y) LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=None, normalize=False) dt.fit(d, y) DecisionTreeRegressor(ccp_alpha=0.0, criterion=&#39;mse&#39;, max_depth=None, max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, presort=&#39;deprecated&#39;, random_state=None, splitter=&#39;best&#39;) p1 = lm.predict(d) p2 = dt.predict(d) d[&#39;y&#39;] = y d[&#39;lm&#39;] = p1 d[&#39;dt&#39;] = p2 D = pd.melt(d, id_vars = &#39;x&#39;) sns.relplot(data=D, x = &#39;x&#39;, y = &#39;value&#39;, hue = &#39;variable&#39;) &lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid object at 0x12eadaca0&gt; plt.show() 7.3 A data analytic example diamonds = pd.read_csv(&#39;data/diamonds.csv.gz&#39;) diamonds.info() &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 53940 entries, 0 to 53939 Data columns (total 10 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 carat 53940 non-null float64 1 cut 53940 non-null object 2 color 53940 non-null object 3 clarity 53940 non-null object 4 depth 53940 non-null float64 5 table 53940 non-null float64 6 price 53940 non-null int64 7 x 53940 non-null float64 8 y 53940 non-null float64 9 z 53940 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(6), int64(1), object(3) memory usage: 4.1+ MB First, lets separate out the outcome (price) and the predictors y = diamonds.pop(&#39;price&#39;) For many machine learning problems, it is useful to scale the numeric predictors so that they have mean 0 and variance 1. First we need to separate out the categorical and numeric variables d1 = diamonds.select_dtypes(include = &#39;number&#39;) d2 = diamonds.select_dtypes(exclude = &#39;number&#39;) Now let’s scale the columns of d1 from sklearn.preprocessing import scale bl = scale(d1) bl array([[-1.19816781, -0.17409151, -1.09967199, -1.58783745, -1.53619556, -1.57112919], [-1.24036129, -1.36073849, 1.58552871, -1.64132529, -1.65877419, -1.74117497], [-1.19816781, -3.38501862, 3.37566251, -1.49869105, -1.45739502, -1.74117497], ..., [-0.20662095, 0.73334442, 1.13799526, -0.06343409, -0.04774083, 0.03013526], [ 0.13092691, -0.52310533, 0.24292836, 0.37338325, 0.33750627, 0.28520393], [-0.10113725, 0.31452784, -1.09967199, 0.08811478, 0.11861587, 0.14349912]]) Woops!! We get a numpy array, not a DataFrame!! bl = pd.DataFrame(scale(d1)) bl.columns = list(d1.columns) d1 = bl Now, let’s recode the categorical variables into dummy variables. d2 = pd.get_dummies(d2) and put them back together X = pd.concat([d1,d2], axis = 1) Next we need to split the data into a training set and a test set. Usually we do this as an 80/20 split. The purpose of the test set is to see how well the model works on an “external” data set. We don’t touch the test set until we’re done with all our model building in the training set. We usually do the split using random numbers. We’ll put 40,000 observations in the training set. ind = list(X.index) np.random.shuffle(ind) X_train, y_train = X.loc[ind[:40000],:], y[ind[:40000]] X_test, y_test = X.loc[ind[40000:],:], y[ind[40000:]] There is another way to do this from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y , test_size = 0.2, random_state= 40) Now we will fit our models to the training data. Let’s use a decision tree model, a random forest model, and a linear regression. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor lm = LinearRegression() dt = DecisionTreeRegressor() rf = RandomForestRegressor() Now we will use our training data to fit the models lm.fit(X_train, y_train) LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=None, normalize=False) dt.fit(X_train, y_train) DecisionTreeRegressor(ccp_alpha=0.0, criterion=&#39;mse&#39;, max_depth=None, max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, presort=&#39;deprecated&#39;, random_state=None, splitter=&#39;best&#39;) rf.fit(X_train, y_train) RandomForestRegressor(bootstrap=True, ccp_alpha=0.0, criterion=&#39;mse&#39;, max_depth=None, max_features=&#39;auto&#39;, max_leaf_nodes=None, max_samples=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=100, n_jobs=None, oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0, warm_start=False) We now need to see how well the model fit the data. We’ll use the R2 statistic to be our metric of choice to evaluate the model fit. from sklearn.metrics import r2_score f&quot;&quot;&quot; Linear regression: {r2_score(y_train, lm.predict(X_train))}, Decision tree: {r2_score(y_train, dt.predict(X_train))}, Random Forest: {r2_score(y_train, rf.predict(X_train))} &quot;&quot;&quot; &#39;\\nLinear regression: 0.9202636015648039, \\nDecision tree: 0.9999965428396391,\\nRandom Forest: 0.9973191241132855\\n&#39; This is pretty amazing. However, we know that if we try and predict using the same data we used to train the model, we get better than expected results. One way to get a better idea about the true performance of the model when we will try it on external data is to do cross-validation. In cross-validation, we split the dataset up into 5 equal parts randomly. We then train the model using 4 parts and predict the data on the 5th part. We do for all possible groups of 4 parts. We then consider the overall performance of prediction. from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score cv_score = cross_val_score(dt, X_train, y_train, cv=5) f&quot;CV error = {np.mean(cv_score)}&quot; &#39;CV error = 0.9646437995354757&#39; If we weren’t satisfied with this performance, we could optimize the parameters of the decision tree to see if we could improve performance. The way to do that would be to use sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV, giving it ranges of the parameters we want to optimize. For a decision tree these would be the maximum depth of the tree, the size of the smallest leaf, and the maximum number of features (predictors) to consider at each split. See help(DecisionTreeRegressor) for more details. So how does this do on the test set? p = dt.predict(X_test) r2_score(y_test, p) 0.9650870355748792 "],
["string-manipulation.html", "Chapter 8 String manipulation 8.1 Regular expressions", " Chapter 8 String manipulation String manipulation is one of Python’s strong suites. It comes built in with methods for strings, and the re module (for regular expressions) ups that power many fold. Strings are objects that we typically see in quotes. We can also check if a variable is a string. a = &#39;Les Miserable&#39; type(a) &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; Strings are a little funny. They look like they are one thing, but they can act like lists. In some sense they are really a container of characters. So we can have len(a) 13 a[:4] &#39;Les &#39; a[3:6] &#39; Mi&#39; The rules are basically the same as lists. To make this explicit, let’s consider the word ‘bare’. In terms of positions, we can write this out. index 0 1 2 3 string b a r e neg index -4 -3 -2 -1 We can also slices strings (and lists for that matter) in intervals. So, going back to a, a[::2] &#39;LsMsrbe&#39; slices every other character. Strings come with several methods to manipulate them natively. &#39;White Knight&#39;.capitalize() &#39;White knight&#39; &quot;It&#39;s just a flesh wound&quot;.count(&#39;u&#39;) 2 &#39;Almond&#39;.endswith(&#39;nd&#39;) True &#39;White Knight&#39;.lower() &#39;white knight&#39; &#39;White Knight&#39;.upper() &#39;WHITE KNIGHT&#39; &#39;flesh wound&#39;.replace(&#39;flesh&#39;,&#39;bullet&#39;) &#39;bullet wound&#39; &#39; This is my song &#39;.strip() &#39;This is my song&#39; &#39;Hello, hello, hello&#39;.split(&#39;,&#39;) [&#39;Hello&#39;, &#39; hello&#39;, &#39; hello&#39;] One of the most powerful string methods is join. This allows us to take a list of characters, and then put them together using a particular separator. &#39; &#39;.join([&#39;This&#39;,&#39;is&#39;,&#39;my&#39;,&#39;song&#39;]) &#39;This is my song&#39; Also recall that we are allowed “string arithmetic”. &#39;g&#39; + &#39;a&#39; + &#39;f&#39; + &#39;f&#39; + &#39;e&#39; &#39;gaffe&#39; &#39;a &#39;*5 &#39;a a a a a &#39; 8.0.1 String formatting In older code, you will see a formal format statement. var = &#39;horse&#39; var2 = &#39;car&#39; s = &#39;Get off my {}!&#39; s.format(var) &#39;Get off my horse!&#39; s.format(var2) &#39;Get off my car!&#39; This is great for templates. template_string = &quot;&quot;&quot; {country}, our native village There was a {species} tree. We used to sleep under it. &quot;&quot;&quot; print(template_string.format(country=&#39;India&#39;, species = &#39;banyan&#39;)) India, our native village There was a banyan tree. We used to sleep under it. print(template_string.format(country = &#39;Canada&#39;, species = &#39;maple&#39;)) Canada, our native village There was a maple tree. We used to sleep under it. In Python 3.6+, the concept of f-strings or formatted strings was introduced. They can be easier to read, faster and have better performance. country = &#39;USA&#39; f&quot;This is my {country}!&quot; &#39;This is my USA!&#39; 8.1 Regular expressions Regular expressions are amazingly powerful tools for string search and manipulation. They are available in pretty much every computer language in some form or the other. I’ll provide a short and far from comprehensive introduction here.
