# Assignments During Workshop

There are two types of assignments. The majority are very short and accompany a screen cast type video. These are very useful for an online workshop as is prevents people from listening to lectures over zoom for hours on end and allows working at ones own pace. The other type are longer and in the form of `Jupyter Notebooks` which include extensive commenting to get more experience with practical examples of `Python` use in Bioinformatics.

The course uses Canvas, so the assignments are given from there. This simply contains them for reference in one place.
