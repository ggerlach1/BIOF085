# Assignments During Workshop

Most of the assignments are very short and can be completed with only a couple lines of code. The exceptions are the assignments at the end of day 2 and day 3 which are longer form and involve filling in`Jupyer Notebooks` using the previously learned material.

The course uses Canvas, so the assignments are given from there. This simply contains them for reference in one place.
